It is a combination of uAPI and HW specification.

revoke here means you take a MR object and tell it to stop doing DMA
without causing the MR object to be destructed.

All the drivers can of course destruct the MR, but doing such a
destruction without explicit synchronization with user space opens
things up to a serious use-after potential that could be a security
issue.

When the open handle closes the userspace is synchronized with the
kernel and we can destruct the HW objects safely.

So, the special HW feature required is 'stop doing DMA but keep the
object in an error state' which isn't really implemented, and doesn't
extend very well to other object types beyond simple MRs.

I would expect this is blocked so long as the DMABUF exists - eg the
DMABUF will hold a fget on the FD of #1 until the DMABUF is closed, so
that #3 can't actually happen.

That's just bug, don't make buggy drivers :)
