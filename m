How are the counters which the HUD consumes declared?

See what I want to avoid is a) to nail down the interface with the 
kernel on specific values and b) make it possible to easily expose new 
values.

In other words what we could do with fdinfo is to have something like this:

GALLIUM_FDINFO_HUD=drm-memory-vram,amd-evicted-vram,amd-mclk glxgears

And the HUD just displays the values the kernel provides without the 
need to re-compile mesa when we want to add some more values nor have 
the values as part of the UAPI.

Christian.

                                    but I also see why other drivers do
                                    a lot of the stuff we have as IOCTL
                                    as separate files in sysfs, fdinfo
                                    or debugfs.<br>

                                    Especially repeating all the static
                                    information which were already
                                    available under sysfs in the INFO
                                    IOCTL was a design mistake as far as
                                    I can see. Just compare what AMDGPU
                                    and the KFD code is doing to what
                                    for example i915 is doing.<br>

                                    information about a process. The
                                    fdinfo stuff can be queried from
                                    external tools (gdb, gputop, umr

                          put this into fdinfo together with the other

                          If you want to make allocation decisions based
                          on this then we should have that as IOCTL or
                          even better as mmap() page between kernel and
                          userspace. But in this case I would also
                          calculation the numbers completely different
                          as well.<br>
                          <br>
                          See we have at least the following things in
                          the kernel:<br>
                          1. The eviction list in the VM.<br>
                              Those are the BOs which are currently
                          evicted and tried to moved back in on the next
                          CS.<br>
                          <br>
                          2. The VRAM over commit value.<br>
                              In other words how much more VRAM than
                          available has the application tried to
                          allocate?<br>
                          <br>
                          3. The visible VRAM usage by this application.<br>
                          <br>
                          The end goal is that the eviction list will go
                          away, e.g. we will always have stable
                          allocations based on allocations of other
                          applications and not constantly swap things in
                          and out.<br>
                          <br>
                          When you now expose the eviction list to
                          userspace we will be stuck with this interface
                          forever.<br>

                      <div>The only missing thing is the size of all
                        evicted VRAM allocations, and the size of all
                        evicted visible VRAM allocations.<br>

                      <div>1. No list is exposed. Only sums of buffer
                        sizes are exposed. Also, the eviction list has
                        no meaning here. All lists are treated equally,
                        and mem_type is compared with preferred_domains
                        to determine where buffers are and where they
                        should be.<br>

                      <div>2. I'm not interested in the overcommit
                        value. I'm only interested in knowing the number
                        of bytes of evicted VRAM right now. It can be as
                        variable as the CPU load, but in practice it
                        shouldn't be because PCIe doesn't have the
                        bandwidth to move things quickly.<br>
