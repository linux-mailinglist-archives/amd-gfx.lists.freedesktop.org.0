So that's what its about. Somehow I knew it all along. Not long ago, I 
posted this on reddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/183gye7/rx_6700xt_from_230w_to_capped_115w_at_only_10/

That was 3 months ago. Now suddenly AMD *require*("..hardware engineers 
have explicitly pointed out that we *have to* do this in the software 
stack", "..open source drivers are *not respecting* the min value") that 
you fix min_cap hard. What a coincidence, with unlimited min_cap being 
fine for years. What is the statistical probability that just 3 months 
after someone blow it into public, they patch the driver to "respect 
firmware" and thing is suddenly "out of specs". I don't know.

Maybe someone remind them we do not work for them and we don't care for 
their marketing strategies. What is it to them if user can override 
kernel value? Card literally cannot die, I cannot fry it, I am not going 
over peak allowed power but opposite. Whether I have to do it via boot 
or patch a kernel should not be up to them.

By all means set min_cap to specification, but do allow for override. 
That's all we ask, there are many users and more issues about this 
opened on gitlab than just mine.

Also the points about vendors knowing and defining range due to HW 
components... please. How come they haven't seen such a huge savings 
when HW is clearly operating safe? To me this is intentional and have to 
do about how bad may future HW sell, like an arbitrary hold-back to milk 
money(kind of what Intel did for many CPU generations). Because they 
don't have much room on the die shrink and other optimizations also 
happened over decades. Things are saturated everywhere. You can show 
nice upgrade charts on how next gen. beat 6700XT if it draw ~200W, but 
can next gen beat it to warrant purchase if my 6700XT get almost same 
perf., but on **80% less** power? That efficiency ratio is so blown out 
it leave few jaws on the floor and 2-3 generations obsolete. No wonder 
they have to fake specs. I don't believe them a word, cards operate 
safely and this could not be missed.
