Dear Alex,

The situation is more than concerning and my frustration, as well as others=
, is growing.

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3787
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2950

There has been a hundred of reports on gitlab, I can find more on reddit, t=
ech1level forum, phoronix forum, I got confirmation by some folks on Matrix=
 that are staying in 6.1 and are starting to mock the amdgpu driver. I've s=
een features after features being merged in amdgpu yet people are laughing =
in forum, at how bugs are not fixed. On reddit, some users decided to go ba=
ck on Windows because of it.

There has been 4 bisection attempts so far, that led to no result, and (I'm=
 in part at fault here for having used an experimental filesystem with majo=
r version changes). There are people that managed to grasp debug infos befo=
re the timeout.

In two months, this significant issue will be a year old.=20

I do not understand, how you guys are not hitting it/trying to bisect it. A=
re you not keeping your machine up for more than 30 sec.
With the immense spectrum of hardware concerned, I cannot believe that you =
guys are immune to this. And I cannot believe that you guys are letting thi=
s rot.

Right now, only a minority is managing to recover their session after a few=
 minutes. Some people are able to get away with it by enabling the debug fl=
ag, but this only work for some people and there are no guarantees that it =
will last long.=20

Please,
It's time to forget trying to pass the hotball and get a maintainer investi=
gate and fix this before it gets too late. If we let it rot another year, n=
o one will be able to bisect it because distros and hardware will make use =
of recent versions only.
