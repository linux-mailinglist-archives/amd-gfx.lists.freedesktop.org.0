Unfortunately, not every issue is readily reproducible and the issues
you've noted are pretty generic.  There can be a lot of root causes
for these kinds of issues.  If you can't bisect your issue, I would
suggest trying a newer kernel as we've fixed quite a number of issues
that manifest in a similar way over the last few months.
