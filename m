I'm curious, how does the refcount of a PageAnon() DEVICE_COHERENT page
look like when mapped? I'd assume it's also (currently) still offset by
one, meaning, if it's mapped into a single page table it's always at
least 2.

Just a note that if my assumption is correct and if we'd have such a
page mapped R/O, do_wp_page() would always have to copy it
unconditionally and would not be able to reuse it on write faults.
(while I'm working on improving the reuse logic, I think there is also
work in progress to avoid this additional reference on some ZONE_DEVICE
stuff -- I'd assume that would include DEVICE_COHERENT ?)

We really should have the same pinning rules for GUP vs. GUP-fast.
is_pinnable_page() should be the right place for such checks (similarly
as indicated in my reply to the migration series).
