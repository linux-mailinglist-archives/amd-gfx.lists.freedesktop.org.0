 Linus pulls them into mainline.  At that point, mainline goes into RCs a=

he best way to get it into mainline?  I guess ideally it would be fixed i=
n mainline and them mainline would be merged into everyone's -next branch=
, but that's not always practical.  Often times new features depend on bu=

 merge, or you'd have to rebase your -next branches regularly so that the=
y would shed any patches in mainline which is not great either.  We try a=
nd cherry-pick -x when we can to show the relationship.

Thanks a bunch Alex, I appreciate your time detailing the issue, which
seems...quite complex and annoying, indeed =3D{

What I'll do from now on is trying to check all hashes that match a
commit, so I can add more than one fixes tag if that makes sense. At
least, this way I can prevent missing fixes in stable like this patch heh=


@Greg, can you pick this one? Thanks!

Cheers,


Guilherme
