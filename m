Awesome, that you review the code with your expertise. Though I suggest 
to look at and work on agd5f/amd-staging-drm-next [1], having the latest 
code for the driver.

I am looking forward to it. To not get lost in all the problems, one 
email or issue per problem might be a good way forward, and adding 
people adding the code (`git blame -w`) to Cc might also help.

Happy debugging and hacking!


Kind regards,

Paul
