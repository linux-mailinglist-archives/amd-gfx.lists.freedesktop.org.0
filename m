To clarify: I do agree with Michel and Kruno that in most typical use cases
you'd probably want to get all or as much of the internal HW pipelines
precision as possible to the Eyes of the person in front of the display, or
at least an approximation of it. My understanding of current AMD hardware
is that you can have an up to 16 bpc framebuffer, which gets
truncated/rounded down to 12 bpc somewhere in the pipeline (gamma tables,
color transformation matrices, etc.) and then retained at 12 bpc until
shortly before the actual output, which can be 6, 8, 10 or 12 bpc depending
on connection type, bandwidth, "max bpc" etc.

If the final output depth is lower than 12 bpc one would usually still want
an approximation of 12 bpc reaching the "eyes" of the person
(/animal/retina in some of the use cases of my research users) in front of
the display, and spatial dithering down from 12 bpc -> 10/8/6 bpc is the
way to go. That's also true for most of my users use cases, and especially
for the use cases involving 16 bpc framebuffers/surfaces.

Some more special use cases will require an absolutely perfect identity
passthrough of pixel color values, where any kind of transformation in the
pipeline, including spatial dithering, would be bad. Some of your customers
seem to require this for 10 bpc output. Some of my users require this for 8
bpc output of a 8 bpc framebuffer. Specifically, some neuroscience research
requires up to 16 bpc color or luminance precision, but all graphics cards
and normal displays max out at 12 bpc. There exist special display devices
and converters that can do up to 16 bpc precision (native or via some form
of spatial or temporal dithering), e.g., the Bits# or Display++ from
Cambridge Research Systems (UK) and Datapixx, ViewPixx and ProPixx devices
from VPixx in Canada. These are essentially active DVI-D or DisplayPort 8
bpc to 14 bpc or 16 bpc VGA analog converters with 14 or 16 DAC's, or
special purpose LCD panels or DLP video projectors which can do 14/16 bpc
precision. Because commercially available gpu's and PHY's do not support
true 16 bpc output (the DP and HDMI standards specify such signal formats,
but no actual transmitter hardware afaik), these devices encode 16 bpc
color content on top of a 8 bpc framebuffer and link: The software renders
16 bpc unorm/fp or 32 bpc float content and then uses GLSL shaders to split
up 16 bpc into 8 MSB and 8 LSB and puts the 8 MSB into the 8 bpc red
channel and 8 LSB into the 8 bpc blue channel (and 8 bpc color index
overlay into the 8 bpc blue channel) to false-color encode a pure grayscale
image + some 256 color index palette overlay. Or for true color images, it
sacrifices half the horizontal resolution by putting 8 MSB of each color
channel into the even pixel columns, and the 8 LSB into the odd pixel
columns. So a false color 8 rgb8 framebuffer -> pixel identity passthrough
-> 8 bpc link output via DVI-D or DP, and the video sink then decodes and
reassembles again into 16 bpc color/luminance content and uses special
display hardware to these 16 bpc into the eyes of the being in front of the
display. Some medical imaging displays, e.g., for Radiology use (e.g.,
cancer screening) in hospitals or at eye doctors, also use such special
framebuffer encodings to get > 12 bpc content out of the gpu Siemens
Medical and similar companies sell these for research and medical use.

Another use case of my users requiring perfect pixel identity passthrough
is to encode side-band signals into the scanlines of the vactive area of an
image, encoding binary control data and packets as false color pixel
values, similar to the various info packets transmitted inside vblank. This
for control data that is very custom and not standardized in any Vesa or
HDMI standard, e.g., in my case to control special neuroscience hardware,
e.g., sound microsecond synchronized to pictures, sending various analog
waveforms to electrophysiology equipment or haptic stimulation, or digital
trigger signals to transmagnetic stimulators (magnetic pulses to brain
regions), or start/stop/synchronize various recording equipment (fMRI and
MEG scanners, electrophysiological recordings, video capture etc.)

For the pixel identity passthrough, the difference is that I only need it
for 8 bpc framebuffers to 8 bpc (DVI-D or DP) outputs atm., and that works
fine under OpenGL with an identity gamma table loaded, despite spatial
dithering down to 8 bpc active. Right now, I neither have the need nor the
equipment to verify 10 bpc identity passthrough, as my capture hw can only
process 8 bpc signals.

I don't think there is an automated way for the driver to guess the proper
configuration in all cases. The proper solution would be a drm connector
property that can be queried/set to control dithering on/off/method/target
depth, and plumb that through. Or maybe something that could be derived
from existing connector properties? E.g., if a content property has
something standardized that essentially requires identity passthrough? In
my case, it is important that such settings still fully work under native
X11 via RandR properties. Something that is only realistically accessible
via an atomic client or Wayland server is insufficient for me.

So yes, as Michel points out, there is a disconnect between the framebuffer
color depth and hw pipeline depth and what dither settings should be used.
But Harry's patch, if it worked, would be at least a good enough
guess-o-matic or heuristic to make the situation better in the short
term, even if it is not optimal. Or at least for my users use cases it
would make it better, as for my use cases the framebuffer color depth
usually corresponds to what my users need as effective output precision.
For me there is also the urgency of wanting to have a not broken situation
for Linux 7.0 and upcoming Ubuntu 26.04-LTS / Fedora Core 44. If I have the
choice of having the current state, or this patch, I'd gladly have this
patch as a step up.

I hoped this patch would be still simple and contained and early enough, to
make it into drm-fixes for Linux 7.0, and maybe be backportable to older
kernels, as all kernels since late 2023 are impaired from my use cases
point of view. But as I said, my testing didn't confirm the patch is
actually working - it always ends up enabling dithering. Which, to be
sneaky, would also be a step up for me, as that "only" breaks use cases
that don't affect my users specifically :/

into the 8 bpc red channel and 8 LSB into the 8 bpc blue channel (and 8 bpc=
 color index overlay into the 8 bpc blue channel) to false-color encode a p=
ure grayscale image=C2=A0+ some 256 color index palette overlay. Or for tru=
e color images, it sacrifices half the horizontal resolution by putting 8 M=
SB of each color channel into the even pixel columns, and the 8 LSB into th=
e odd pixel columns. So a false color 8 rgb8 framebuffer -&gt; pixel identi=
ty passthrough -&gt; 8 bpc link output via DVI-D or DP, and the video sink =
then decodes and reassembles again into 16 bpc color/luminance content and =
uses special display hardware to these 16 bpc into the eyes of the being in=
 front of the display. Some medical imaging displays, e.g., for Radiology u=
se (e.g., cancer screening) in hospitals or at eye doctors, also use such s=
pecial framebuffer encodings to get &gt; 12 bpc content out of the gpu Siem=
ens Medical and similar companies sell these for research and medical use.<=
/div><div><br></div><div>Another use case of my users requiring perfect pix=
el=C2=A0identity passthrough is to encode side-band signals into the scanli=
nes of the vactive area of an image, encoding binary control data and packe=
ts as false color pixel values, similar to the various info packets transmi=
tted inside vblank. This for control data that is very custom and not stand=
ardized in any Vesa or HDMI standard, e.g., in my case to control special n=
euroscience hardware, e.g., sound microsecond synchronized to pictures, sen=

ference is that I only need it for 8 bpc framebuffers to 8 bpc (DVI-D or DP=
) outputs atm., and that works fine under OpenGL with an identity gamma tab=

ther have the need nor the equipment to verify 10 bpc identity passthrough,=
 as my capture hw can only process 8 bpc signals.</div><div><br></div><div>=
I don&#39;t think there is an automated way for the driver to guess the pro=
per configuration in all cases. The proper solution would be a drm connecto=
r property that can be queried/set to control dithering on/off/method/targe=
t depth, and plumb that through. Or maybe something that could be derived f=
rom existing connector properties? E.g., if a content property has somethin=
g standardized that essentially requires identity passthrough? In my case, =
it is important that such settings still fully work under native X11 via Ra=
ndR properties. Something that is only realistically accessible via an atom=
ic client or Wayland server is insufficient for me.</div><div><br></div><di=
v>So yes, as Michel points out, there is a disconnect between the framebuff=

d. But Harry&#39;s patch, if it worked, would be at least a good enough gue=
ss-o-matic or heuristic to make the situation better in the short term,=C2=
=A0even if it is not optimal. Or at least for my users use cases it would m=

 maybe be backportable to older kernels, as all kernels since late 2023 are=

39;t confirm the patch is actually working - it always ends up enabling dit=

only&quot; breaks use cases that don&#39;t affect my users specifically :/<=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I believe we don&#39;t have surface inf=
o in that code, but one way to work around it would be to use spatial dithe=
ring for FP16/ARGB16 and rounding for 10 bits. But if we just switch to spa=
tial, some of the earlier complaints about 10-bit output having one-off bit=
 errors will be coming back.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking at all callers of=C2=A0resource_build_bit_depth_reduct=
ion_params(), they all have access to the associated &quot;struct pipe_ctx&=
quot;, which should give access to pipe_ctx -&gt;plane_state-&gt;format of =
an associated display plane. I could prepare a patch that passes the pipe_c=
tx from each caller into=C2=A0resource_build_bit_depth_reduction_params() a=
nd that function could check if a 16 bpc framebuffer is in use and switch t=
o spatial dithering down-to-10-bpc in this case, and leave the rounding/tru=
ncation to 10 bpc otherwise.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; That doesn&#39;t really make sense, the output of the display HW c=
olour pipeline has more than 10 bpc regardless of framebuffer format.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The output will be determined by the link bandwidth, display-advertise=
d supported bpc, and userspace-selected &quot;max bpc&quot; on a drm_connec=
tor. This could very well be 10 bpc, 8 bpc, even 6 bpc. Or are you referrin=
g to the internal DCN HW representation of the values?<br>
<br>
I am indeed.<br>
<br>
&gt; They&#39;re higher, but that&#39;s somewhat irrelevant.<br>
<br>
How so? Surely dithering is applied to those values, not to the original va=
lues sampled from the framebuffer.<br>
