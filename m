Hi Amir,

> gmc_v11_0/ih_v6_0. I missed that. The gap is only in patch 5's ih_v7_0

First, let me clear up a slight misunderstanding here. The patch series that I 
sent here only contains what I managed to get working on Navi 31, it does not 
contain any code from my attempt at Navi 48.

The patch 5 is just a slight refactor of the pre-existing code and 
(intentionally) doesn't contain any functional changes. It seems that IH 7.1 
relies on the doorbell, so I didn't want to remove it, albeit I have no means 
to verify if that actually works or not.

If you like, I can push a few WIP patches to a different branch tomorrow to 
show you exactly what I did on Navi 48. However, I wouldn't want to submit 
that to the mailing list without first making sure that it works well.

For the attempt on Navi 48, I enabled the CAM in ih_v7_0 the same way I do for 
ih_v6_0 in the series. But, because I couldn't get it fully working, I didn't 
include any of that code in the series.

I think this explanation may fit what I saw.
Why is it not reaching UTC L0?
Also, how do you inspect this stuff in umr?

I see. I think I needed to change some gfxhub registers to get those src_data 
bits that you are missing.

My test case is a simple Vulkan shader which I am executing with vkrunner. 
Each shader invocation does an out of bounds read from a different page. For 
Navi 31 (and Strix Halo), I started out with just 1 page fault, and once I 
could mitigate that reliably, I turned it up to several hundred faults.

This may be related to a flaw in amdgpu_gmc_handle_retry_fault():
what the function does is first call amdgpu_vm_handle_fault() which kicks off an 
SDMA job to update page tables, and then it ACKs the filter CAM. However, at 
the moment when the CAM is ACKed, the SDMA job is not finished yet, so the CP 
sees that the page is still invalid and the page fault interrupt is fired 
again. I actually noticed that on Navi 31 too, but it's just not fatal there. 
It just basically handles the same page fault twice. Once we solve this flaw, I 
would like to propose to enable retry faults by default on Navi 3.

Here is an idea for a solution:

Instead of ACKing the CAM right away, we should do it after the SDMA fence is 
signalled, ie. when we are sure the page tables are updated. Maybe we can set 
a callback on the fence and do it there, though it would require a slight code 
churn to get that to work.

What do you think?

Why, though? 

The ih_v7_0 code does set up the IH1 ring and configure it exactly the same as 
the ih_v6_0, so I don't see why it wouldn't work?

The timestamp issue actually gave me an endless headache when I first got into 
this topic in December. I hope the patch helps!

Best regards,
Timur
