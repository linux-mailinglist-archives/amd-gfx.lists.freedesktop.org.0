Fwiw, the tested DCE-8.3 was a mullins APU, at least that one was fine,
although only testable with 10 bpc HDMI + 6 bpc eDP, the only available
outputs.

I just sent out a patch to restrict the dithering restriction to DCE-11.0.
Successfully retested on DCE-11.2 via DP for extra care.

Have a nice weekend,
