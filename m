Hello Mario,

Interesting case.

The reason why that's done at the very beginning is that there are no
guarantees that the firmware-provided framebuffer would keep working
after the real display controller driver re-initializes the IP block.

Right. That's a problem indeed but as mentioned there's a gap between
the firmware-provided framebuffer is removed and the real driver sets
up its framebuffer.

I'm not familiar with AMD GPUs, but could be possible that this discovery
and firmware loading step be done at the beginning before the firmware FB
is removed ? That way the FB removal will not happen unless that succeeds.

The problem I see is that depending on how far the driver's probe function
went, there may not be possible to re-run the init process. Since firmware
provided framebuffer may already been destroyed or the IP block just be in
a half initialized state.

I'm not against this series if it solves the issue in practice for amdgpu,
but don't think is a general solution and would like to know Thomas' opinion
on this before as well.
