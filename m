I guess, I am confused, which Chrome OS specific commit that is. Is it 
one of the reverted commits below? Which one?

1.  ddab8bd788f5 ("drm/amd/display: Fix two cursor duplication
when using overlay")
2.  e7d9560aeae5 ("Revert "drm/amd/display: Fix overlay validation by 
considering cursors"")

Your reply from August 2021 to commit ddab8bd788f5 (drm/amd/display: Fix 
two cursor duplication when using overlay) from April 2021 [2]:

So, I would have thought, everything worked fine before some Linux 
kernel commit changed behavior, and regressed userspace.


Kind regards,

Paul
