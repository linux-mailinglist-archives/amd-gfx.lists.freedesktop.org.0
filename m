OK, that looks like it's made the GPU blow up straight away, which is 
what I was hoping for (and also appears to reveal another bug where it's 
not handling probe failure very well - possibly trying to remove a 
non-existent audio device?). Lightdm presumably fails to start because 
it doesn't find any display devices, since amdgpu failed to probe.

If you can boot the same kernel without "iommu.forcedac" and get a 
successful probe and working display, that will imply that it is 
managing to work OK with 32-bit DMA addresses, at which point I'd have 
to leave it to Christian and Alex to figure out exactly where DMA 
addresses are getting mangled. The only thing that stands out to me is 
the reference to "gfx_v6_0", which makes me wonder whether it's related 
to gmc_v6_0_sw_init() where a 44-bit DMA mask gets set. If so, that 
would suggest that either this particular model of GPU is more limited 
than expected, or that SoC only has 40 bits of address wired up between 
the PCI host bridge and the IOMMU.

Cheers,
Robin.
