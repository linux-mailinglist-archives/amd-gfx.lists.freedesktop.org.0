Thx for the report.

The problem is quite old and maybe nobody will take a closer look,
unless you find the change that broke things using a bisection – and
even then there is no guarantee that it will be fixed due to how long it
exists already.

Developers of the driver in question also expect bugs to be reported to
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues , which might be why
nobody replied here yet.

So it's likely best if you report the problem there and ask for advice
first before investing time in a bisection.

Ciao, Thorsten
