Hello!

The 2022 X.Org Developers Conference is being held in conjunction with
the 2022 Wine Developers Conference.  This is a meeting to bring
together developers working on all things open graphics (Linux kernel,
Mesa, DRM, Wayland, X11, etc.) as well as developers for the Wine
Project, a key consumer of open graphics.

Registration & Call for Proposals are now open for both XDC 2022 and
WineConf 2022, which will take place on October 4-6, 2022 in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. 

https://xdc2022.x.org
 
As usual, the conference is free of charge and open to the general
public. If you plan on attending, please make sure to register as early
as possible!
 
In order to register as attendee, you will therefore need to do it via
the XDC website:
 
https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/2/registrations/2/
 
In addition to registration, the CfP is now open for talks, workshops
and demos at XDC 2022. While any serious proposal will be gratefully
considered, topics of interest to X.Org and freedesktop.org developers
are encouraged. The program focus is on new development, ongoing
challenges and anything else that will spark discussions among
attendees in the hallway track.
 
We are open to talks across all layers of the graphics stack, from the
kernel to desktop environments / graphical applications and about how
to make things better for the developers who build them. Head to the
CfP page to learn more: 
 
https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/2/abstracts/
 
The deadline for submissions is Monday July 4th, 2022.
 
Check out our Reimbursement Policy to accept speaker
expenses for X.Org events like XDC 2022:
 
https://www.x.org/wiki/XorgFoundation/Policies/Reimbursement/

If you have any questions, please send me an email to
xdc@codeweavers.com, adding on CC the X.org board (board
at foundation.x.org).
 
And don't forget, you can follow us on Twitter for all the latest
updates and to stay connected:

Best regards,
Lyude Paul, on behalf of X.org
