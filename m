Okay, I did a read and compare after each write.

Both writes seem to go through on both the Kaveri and s9150:

Kaveri (512MB UMA Buffer):
amdgpu 0000:00:01.0: amdgpu: [drm] uvd_v4_2_mc_resume: mmUVD_LMI_ADDR_EXT: gpu_addr=0xF41FA00000, addr=0x00000001, wrote 0x00001001, read 0x00001001 [same]
amdgpu 0000:00:01.0: amdgpu: [drm] uvd_v4_2_mc_resume: mmUVD_LMI_EXT40_ADDR: gpu_addr=0xF41FA00000, addr=0x000000F4, wrote 0x800900F4, read 0x800900F4 [same]

s9150:
amdgpu 0000:41:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] uvd_v4_2_mc_resume: mmUVD_LMI_ADDR_EXT: gpu_addr=0xF7FFA00000, addr=0x0000000F, wrote 0x0000F00F, read 0x0000F00F [same]
amdgpu 0000:41:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] uvd_v4_2_mc_resume: mmUVD_LMI_EXT40_ADDR: gpu_addr=0xF7FFA00000, addr=0x000000F7, wrote 0x800900F7, read 0x800900F7 [same]

Thanks,
John
