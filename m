Hi Shaoyun,

> I checked your patch , you try to use query_scheduler_status package  to check the command completion . It  may not work as expected since this API query the status is for MES itself , so mes can update the fence address with  the expected seq value, but the  command  itself (ex .remove_queue for mes and  then  mes send the  unmap_queue to kiq internally)  still fails.

And that is exactly the desired behavior.

See the fence value is for ring buffer processing and getting feedback 
in the case of a reset for example if the MES has processed the commands.

If that processing is successfully or not *must* be completely 
irrelevant for writing the fence value.

> For mes , driver always poll for the command completion

No, exactly that's what we want to avoid as much as possible.

Polling means that we throw away tons of CPU cycles and especially on 
fault handling and TLB flushing that is an absolutely in-acceptable 
performance loss.

>   ,  do you think it's an acceptable solution that MES set a specific failure value(ex , -1)  in the fence address to indicate the failure of the  operation ?  But that should be similar to let driver poll the completion till timeout .  MES internally also need to wait for a timeout on some  command that it sent  to CP (ex.  2 seconds for unmap_queue command).

No, what we should really do is to separate the fence and the result 
values. And then give an input dependency on each operation.

> I'm actually a little bit confused here , has driver use the lock to ensure there is only one submission into MES at any time ?

No, exactly that's what we try to avoid. Othertwise we don't need a ring 
buffer in the first place.

>   MES can also trigger the interrupt on the failure if driver side require us to do so , the  payload will have the seq number to indicate which submission cause the failure , that might requires more code change from   driver side .Please let me what's preferred from driver side.

I can come up with a more detailed explanation of the driver 
requirements when I'm back from sick leave.

Christian.

Instead we will submit an addition QUERY_STATUS command after the real command and let that one write fence value. This way the fence value is always written, independent of the result of the operation.

Only other alternative is to not scheduler commands behind each other on the ring and that in turn is a bad idea from the performance point of view.

Alex's change allow driver to check the fence for each API without mess around them  .  If you expect MES to stop responding  to further commands  after one API fails , that will introduce combability issue since this design already exist on products for customer and MES also need to works for windows .  Also MES  always need to respond to  some commands like  RESET  etc  that might make things worse if we need to change the logic .

>>> I think it just need to be improved to allow this force-signal behavior. The current behavior is slow/inconvenient, but the old behavior is wrong. Since MES will continue process submissions even when one submission failed. So with just one fence location there's no way to tell if a command failed or not.
