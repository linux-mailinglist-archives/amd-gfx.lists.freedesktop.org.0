So before we toss everything and go an a great rewrite-the-world tour,
what if we just try to split up big objects. So for objects which are
bigger than e.g. 10mb

- move them to a special "under eviction" list
- keep a note how far we evicted thus far
- interleave allocating shmem pages, copying data and releasing the ttm
  backing store on a chunk basis (maybe 10mb or whatever, tuning tbh)

If that's not enough, occasionally break out of the shrinker entirely so
other parts of reclaim can reclaim the shmem stuff. But just releasing our
own pages as we go should help a lot I think.
