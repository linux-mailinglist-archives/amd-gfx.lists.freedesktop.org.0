Hi Mario,

Tested on 7.2-rc2 with your patch applied. The mismatch condition is
unchanged from 6.18.35:

   amdgpu 0000:0b:00.0: VFCT bus number mismatch: table 106 != runtime 11,
       matching by device identity (vendor 0x1002 device 0x1900)
   amdgpu 0000:0b:00.0: Fetched VBIOS from VFCT

Both GPUs initialise fully with your patch.

I also tested 7.2-rc2 without pci=realloc,assign-busses to check whether
the pci/realloc changes fixed the dGPU probe failure. They did not -- the
dGPU still fails on 7.2-rc2:

   amdgpu 0000:03:00.0: Fatal error during GPU init
   amdgpu 0000:03:00.0: probe with driver amdgpu failed with error -12

Without the kernel argument the iGPU sits at its POST bus (0x6A), VFCT
matches directly, and it works fine -- but the dGPU is unusable.
pci=realloc,assign-busses remains necessary for this machine on 7.2-rc2,
which means the VFCT mismatch persists and your patch is still needed.

Thank you for not giving up on me so quickly!
This is my first time working on such issue. It feels
daunting to modify kernel code.

Oz

      Thanks. Can you please test 7.2-rc2?
      <br>
      <br>
      I'll clean up the workaround and propose it for review in
      parallel.

            No, the notice does not appear without
            pci=realloc,assign-busses. The iGPU  stays at its POST bus
            (0x6A = 106), VFCT matches directly, and it fetches the
            VBIOS without any mismatch.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, dropping the kernel argument is not an option on
            this machine:
            <br>
            without it the discrete GPU (0x7449) fails to probe
            entirely:

            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            The firmware BARs cannot be mapped without resource
            reallocation, so
            <br>
            pci=realloc,assign-busses is required for the dGPU, which in
            turn reassigns
            <br>
            the iGPU to bus 0x0B and triggers the mismatch your patch
            resolves.

          Got it; thanks for clarifying.  I would like to dig a little
          bit futher into that though.  What kernel are you finding this
          behavior and can it still reproduce with 7.2-rc2 if it's
          older? There was a bunch of pci/realloc changes that happened
          in the last cycle that might have helped this.
          <br>
          <br>
          Also; is it an eGPU (external) or dGPU (internal)?
          <br>
          <br>
          If it's an dGPU IMO this is arguably a BIOS issue that not
          enough resources were applied in the first place.

                Tested on a Morefine MNAS X1 AI Workstation (AMD Ryzen 7

                The VFCT entry for the iGPU has PCIBus=106 (0x6A,
                recorded at POST) while the
                <br>
                runtime bus is 11 (0x0B). Your patch fires exactly as

                The iGPU initialises fully and drives the framebuffer.

                One minor nit: the dev_notice format string ends with

                <br>
                than \n. The resulting kernel message has a literal "\n"
                at the end. Same issue
                <br>
                exists in the nearby "too short #2" dev_info -- not
                introduced by your patch, but

              Thanks for confirming.  Before I split up this patch and
              post it in smaller logical pieces can you confirm my
              proposed root cause is right that this issue happens
              because "pci=realloc,assign-busses" was on your kernel
              command line?

                  Well there's a variety of ways to do it.  But how
                  about we start here - if we make that specific busnr
                  match optional and instead make a VID/DID match.

                        The fallback is only reached if all existing
                        paths have already failed,
                        <br>
                        so there is no regression risk for boards where
                        VFCT or ROM BAR work.

                      What happens if the VBIOS changes in another way
                      one boot to another? You might have some other
                      stateful information that isn't updated.

                      The whole thing to me feels like a hack for a
                      behavior we can control in the kernel when doing
                      reassignments.

                        v2: Fix commit message: clarify that VFCT
                        contains the iGPU entry but
                        <br>
                             with a stale PCIBus from BIOS POST that
                        mismatches the runtime bus
                        <br>
                             number assigned by
                        pci=realloc,assign-busses. Explain that the
                        VBIOS
                        <br>
                             image data is valid and document the dd
                        extraction command and byte
                        <br>
                             offsets.  Note that the UEFI GOP driver
                        initialises the iGPU
                        <br>
                             successfully, confirming the hardware is
                        functional.
