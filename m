That's not an option. We're not adding an eviction fence. The 
reservation object with the eviction fence is shared between the 
exported BO and the imported one. That's just how DMABuf works. If you 
wait for the fences on the imported BO, you are effectively waiting for 
the fences on the exported BOs. And you can't remove the eviction fence 
from the exported BO.
