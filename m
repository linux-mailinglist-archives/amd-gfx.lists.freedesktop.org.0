Right. Hierarchical cgroup-bpf logic cannot be replicated inside
the program. If you're relying on cgv2 hierarchy to containerize
applications then what I suggested earlier won't work indeed.

Thank you for sharing the details. It certainly helps.

Sounds like either bpf_lsm needs to be made aware of cgv2 (which would
be a great thing to have regardless) or cgroup-bpf needs a drm/gpu specific hook.
I think generic ioctl hook is too broad for this use case.
I suspect drm/gpu internal state would be easier to access inside
bpf program if the hook is next to gpu/drm. At ioctl level there is 'file'.
It's probably too abstract for the things you want to do.
Like how VRAM/shader/etc can be accessed through file?
Probably possible through a bunch of lookups and dereferences, but
if the hook is custom to GPU that info is likely readily available.
Then such cgroup-bpf check would be suitable in execution paths where
ioctl-based hook would be too slow.
