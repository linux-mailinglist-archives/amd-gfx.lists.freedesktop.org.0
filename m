I first saw this issue with a s9150.  I had serious reservations about
reporting the issue because, in its default configuration, the s9150 has
no display output.  I needed to figure out that yes, this is a real
issue, I didn't just shoot myself in the foot by enabling broken display
hardware.

The issue affects all s9150s in a system, occurs in different slots and
numa nodes, still occurs when other hardware is added or removed, and
follows the s9150 from x399 to a significantly newer b650 system.

The Kaveri iGPU, while also impacted, mainly serves to show that yes,
this issue is happening on more than just some dodgy s9150 setup.

Anyway, hopefully these extra configuration details help narrow down the
problem.

Thanks,
John
