Hi Amir,

Thanks, glad to hear that!

I recommend to also apply "Add fence argument to amdgpu_vm_handle_fault()" =
and=20
"ACK the retry CAM after VM update finishes" as these fix the race between =
the=20
CAM and the SDMA, and should improve the reliability of the whole mechanism=
 in=20
my opinion.

In the meantime I think I figured out what I was missing.
Considering that the FORCE_MISS bits didn't change the behavior, I was=20
thinking that the curlpit must be something else, so I started looking into=
=20
the PTE that is being added.

It all started working for me when I added some new PTE flags to=20
amdgpu_vm_handle_fault(): AMDGPU_PTE_IS_PTE and AMDGPU_PTE_NOALLOC.
With that, I cleaned up my patches and force-pushed them to the same branch:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Venemo/linux/-/commits/ven_retry_faults_navi4

What do you think?

Best regards,
Timur
