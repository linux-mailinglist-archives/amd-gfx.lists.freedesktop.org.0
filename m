My point was just that I wanted to wait for our testing cycle to
complete before I pushed the fix.  In the past I've pushed fixes near
the end of a kernel cycle without waiting for the testing to complete
which ended causing more problems than they fixed.  The testing has
completed and the patch is good.  I'll send Dave and Simona a PR
momentarily.
