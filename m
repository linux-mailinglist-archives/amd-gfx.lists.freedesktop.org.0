Yes, absolutely correct.

Yes, that's the rough picture in my head as well.

Essentially Daniels patch of having an 
amdgpu_device_hwaccess_begin()/_end() was the right approach. You just 
can't do it in the top level IOCTL handler, but rather need it somewhere 
between front end and backend.

Yes, absolutely correct. That's what I also mentioned to Daniel. When we 
are able to nuke the device and any memory access it might do we can 
also signal the fences.

This is essentially what the DRM SRCU is doing as well.

For the hotplug case we could do this in the toplevel since we can 
signal the fence and don't need to block memory management.

But I'm not sure, maybe we should handle it the same way as reset or 
maybe we should have it at the top level.

Christian.

        well good question. My job is to watch over the implementation
        and design and while I always help I can adjust anybodies
        schedule.<br>
        <br>
        Is the patch to print a warning when the hardware is accessed
        without holding the locks merged yet? If not then that would
        probably be a good starting point.<br>

        Then we would need to unify this with the SRCU to make sure that
        we have both the reset lock as well as block the hotplug code

      <p>In my understanding there is a significant difference between
        handling of GPU reset and unplug - while GPU reset use case
        requires any HW accessing code to block and wait for the reset
        to finish and then proceed, hot-unplug<br>
        is permanent and hence no need to wait and proceed but rather
        abort at once.</p>

    Yes, absolutely correct.<br>

      <p> This why I think that in any place we already check for device
        reset we should also add a check for hot-unplug but the handling

    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Yes, that's the rough picture in my head as well.<br>
    <br>
    Essentially Daniels patch of having an
    amdgpu_device_hwaccess_begin()/_end() was the right approach. You
    just can't do it in the top level IOCTL handler, but rather need it
    somewhere between front end and backend.<br>

      <p>Similar to handling device reset for unplug we obviously also
        need to stop and block any MMIO accesses once device is
        unplugged and, as Daniel Vetter mentioned - we have to do it
        before finishing pci_remove (early device fini)<br>
        and not later (when last device reference is dropped from user
        space) in order to prevent reuse of MMIO space we still access
        by other hot plugging devices. As in device reset case we need
        to cancel all delay works, stop drm schedule, complete all
        unfinished fences(both HW and scheduler fences). While you
        stated strong objection to force signalling scheduler fences
        from GPU reset, quote: <br>
      </p>
      <p>"you can't signal the dma_fence waiting. Waiting for a
        dma_fence also means you wait for the GPU reset to finish. When
        we would signal the dma_fence during the GPU reset then we would
        run into memory corruption because the hardware jobs running
        after the GPU reset would access memory which is already freed."<br>
        To my understating this is a key difference with hot-unplug, the
        device is gone, all those concerns are irrelevant and hence we
        can actually force signal scheduler fences (setting and error to
        them before) to force completion of any<br>
        waiting clients such as possibly IOCTLs or async page flips
        e.t.c.<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Yes, absolutely correct. That's what I also mentioned to Daniel.
    When we are able to nuke the device and any memory access it might
    do we can also signal the fences.<br>

      <p>Beyond blocking all delayed works and scheduler threads we also
        need to guarantee no  IOCTL can access MMIO post device unplug
        OR in flight IOCTLs are done before we finish pci_remove
        (amdgpu_pci_remove for us).<br>
        For this I suggest we do something like what we worked on with
        Takashi Iwai the ALSA maintainer recently when he helped
        implementing PCI BARs move support for snd_hda_intel. Take a
        look at<br>

        We also had same issue there, how to prevent MMIO accesses while
        the BARs are migrating. What was done there is a refcount was
        added to count all IOCTLs in flight, for any in flight  IOCTL
        the BAR migration handler would <br>
        block for the refcount to drop to 0 before it would proceed, for
        any later IOCTL it stops and wait if device is in migration
        state. We even don't need the wait part, nothing to wait for, we
        just return with -ENODEV for this case.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    This is essentially what the DRM SRCU is doing as well.<br>
    <br>
    For the hotplug case we could do this in the toplevel since we can
    signal the fence and don't need to block memory management.<br>
    <br>
    But I'm not sure, maybe we should handle it the same way as reset or
    maybe we should have it at the top level.<br>

            was not acceptable because of low level guards on the
            register accessors level which was hurting performance.
            Basically I need a way to prevent any MMIO write accesses
            from kernel driver after device is removed (UMD accesses are
            taken care of by page faulting dummy page). We are using now
            hot-unplug code for Freemont program and so up-streaming
            became more of a priority then before. This MMIO access
            issue is currently my main blocker from up-streaming. Is
            there any way I can assist in pushing this on ?</p>

                      &gt; We have defined two variables in_gpu_reset
                      and reset_sem in adev object. The atomic type
                      variable in_gpu_reset is used to avoid recovery
                      thread reenter and make lower functions return
                      more earlier when recovery start, but couldn't
                      block recovery thread when it access hardware. The
                      r/w semaphore reset_sem is used to solve these
                      synchronization issues between recovery thread and
                      other threads.<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; The original solution locked registers'
                      access in lower functions, which will introduce
                      following issues:<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; 1) many lower functions are used in both
                      recovery thread and others. Firstly we must
                      harvest these functions, it is easy to miss
                      someones. Secondly these functions need select
                      which lock (read lock or write lock) will be used,
                      according to the thread it is running in. If the
                      thread context isn't considered, the added lock
                      will easily introduce deadlock. Besides that, in
                      most time, developer easily forget to add locks
                      for new functions.<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; 2) performance drop. More lower functions are
                      more frequently called.<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; 3) easily introduce false positive lockdep
                      complaint, because write lock has big range in
                      recovery thread, but low level functions will hold
                      read lock may be protected by other locks in other
                      threads.<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; Therefore the new solution will try to add
                      lock protection for ioctls of kfd. Its goal is
                      that there are no threads except for recovery
                      thread or its children (for xgmi) to access
                      hardware when doing GPU reset and resume. So
                      refine recovery thread as the following:<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; Step 0:
                      atomic_cmpxchg(&amp;adev-&gt;in_gpu_reset, 0, 1)<br>
                      &gt;     1). if failed, it means system had a
                      recovery thread running, current thread exit
                      directly;<br>
                      &gt;     2). if success, enter recovery thread;<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; Step 1: cancel all delay works, stop drm
                      schedule, complete all unreceived fences and so
                      on. It try to stop or pause other threads.<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; Step 2: call
                      down_write(&amp;adev-&gt;reset_sem) to hold write
                      lock, which will block recovery thread until other
                      threads release read locks.<br>
                      <br>
                      Those two steps need to be exchanged or otherwise
                      it is possible that new delayed work items etc are
                      started before the lock is taken.<br>
                      <br>
                      Just to make it clear until this is fixed the
                      whole patch set is a NAK.<br>

                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; Step 3: normally, there is only recovery
                      threads running to access hardware, it is safe to
                      do gpu reset now.<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; Step 4: do post gpu reset, such as call all
                      ips' resume functions;<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; Step 5: atomic set adev-&gt;in_gpu_reset as
                      0, wake up other threads and release write lock.
                      Recovery thread exit normally.<br>
                      &gt;<br>
                      &gt; Other threads call the amdgpu_read_lock to
                      synchronize with recovery thread. If it finds that
                      in_gpu_reset is 1, it should release read lock if
                      it has holden one, and then blocks itself to wait
                      for recovery finished event. If thread
                      successfully hold read lock and in_gpu_reset is 0,
                      it continues. It will exit normally or be stopped
                      by recovery thread in step 1.<br>
