It makes sense.  This is an SOC, not a collection of individual
devices.  There are more devices than power rails so the sbios (via
ACPI) has to handle the power rail.  All of the devices using that
power rail have to suspend and tell the sbios before the platform
microcontroller can turn off the power rail.  Presumably there is
something missing that prevents the microcontroller for powering down
the rail.  If the power rail is kept on, the device is never powered
off and still retains its current state.

It's just papering over the problem.  It would be better from a power
perspective for the driver to just not suspend and keep running like
normal.  When the driver is not suspended runtime things like clock
and power gating are active which keep the GPU power at a minimum.

I talked to our sbios team and they seem to think our S0ix
implementation works pretty differently from Intel's.  I'm not really
an expert on this area however.  We have a new team ramping on up this
for Linux however.
