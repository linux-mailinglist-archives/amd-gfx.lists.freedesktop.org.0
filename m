It's different for each engine type, but the basic idea is that it
provides the minimum viable IB that can exercise the functionality.

It's the binary that the driver parses to determine which IP's are
present on the GPU.  It's mainly for debugging the actual binary.  You
shouldn't try and use this on any GPU other than the one that
generated it.

Similar to the discovery binary.  Mainly for debugging the contents of
the binary.  E.g., the data tables and command tables included in it.
You wouldn't want to use this for any GPU other than the one it came
from.

I meant whole GPU reset rather than per queue reset.  How the driver
accomplishes this depends on the individual chip (some will use mode1
some will use mode2, etc.).

This is the raw content of the ring buffer itself.  You can use UMR to
parse the contents and print contents in human readable form.

This is also the raw content.  You'll need a separate tool to parse
this.  I don't remember if UMR can or not off hand.

It would need to be a valid error number for a dma fence.  E.g., like
-ETIME.  The status of the fences determine the status of jobs on the
ring.

yes.  Graphics and Compute Array (it's another name for the GFX/GC IP).

Wasn't sure if it was worth putting this in the glossary since GPR is
a pretty common term in computer processors.

It's the attestation results for the firmwares used by the GPU.

It's available on certain dGPUs.
