Yeah I think with linear modifiers that sepcificy alignment limitations we
need to be _extremely_ precise in what exactly is required, and what not.
There's all kinds of hilarious stuff that might be incompatible, and if we
don't mind those we're right back to the "everyone agrees on what linear
means" falacy.

So if pitch must be a multiple of 64, but cannot be a multiple of 128
(because the hw does not cope with the padding, then that's important).
Other things are alignment constraints on the starting point, and any
padding you need to add at the bottom (yeah some hw overscans and gets
pissed if there's not memory there). So I think it's best to go overboard
here with verbosity.

There's also really funny stuff like power-of-two alignment and things
like that, but I guess we'll get there if that's ever needed. That's also
why I think we don't need to add all possible linear modifiers from the
start, unless there's maybe too much confusion with stuff like "exactly
64b aligned pitch" and "at least 64b aligned pitch, but you can add lots
of padding if you feel like".
