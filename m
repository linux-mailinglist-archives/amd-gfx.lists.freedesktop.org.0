Hello kernel/driver developers,

I hope, with my information it's possible to find a bug/problem in the 
kernel. Otherwise I am sorry, that I disturbed you.
I only use LTS kernels, but I can narrow it down to a hand full of them, 
where it works.

The PC: Manjaro Stable/Cinnamon/X11/AMD Ryzen 5 2600/Radeon HD 7790/8GB 
RAM
I already asked the Manjaro community, but with no luck.

The game: Hellpoint (GOG Linux latest version, Unity3D-Engine v2021), 
uses vulkan

---

I came a long road of kernels. I had many versions of 5.4, 5.10, 5.15, 
6.1 and 6.6 and and the game was always unplayable, because the frames 
where around 1fps (performance of PC is not the problem).
I asked the mesa and cinnamon team for help in the past, but also with 
no luck.
It never worked, till on 2025-03-29 when I installed 6.12.19 for the 
first time and it worked!

But it only worked with 6.12.19, 6.12.20 and 6.12.21
When I updated to 6.12.25, it was back to unplayable.

For testing I installed 6.14.4 with the same result. It doesn't work.

I also compared file /proc/config.gz of both kernels (6.12.21 <> 
6.14.4), but can't seem to see drastic changes to the graphical part.

I presume it has something to do with amdgpu.

If you need more information, I would be happy to help.

Kind regards,
Marion
