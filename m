I'm looking at this now.. The PUD is also changing under the read
mmap_sem - and I was able to think up some race conditiony bugs
related to this. Have some patches now..

However, I haven't been able to understand why walk_page_range()
doesn't check pud_present() or pmd_present() before calling
pmd_offset_map() or pte_offset_map().

As far as I can see a non-present entry has a swap entry encoded in
it, and thus it seems like it is a bad idea to pass a non-present
entry to the two map functions. I think those should only be called
when the entry points to the next level in the page table  (so there
is something to map?)

I see you added !present tests for the !vma case, but why only there?

Is this a bug? Do you know how it works?

Is it something that was missed when people added non-present PUD and
PMD's?

Thanks,
Jason
