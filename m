Okay, thanks. I may have seen some aspect of this before in cases
where GPU reset failed and left processes in an unkillable state.

I'll be honest, I've seen my fair share of exotic GPU hangs and to put
it mildly I'm not impressed by the kernel's handling of them.
Obviously you know much more about the intricacies of kernel memory
management than I do, but the fact that processes can end up in an
unkillable state for *any* GPU-related reason feels to me like the
result of a bad design decision somewhere.

But anyway, I'm not even asking you to fix those problems. All I'm
asking you is to let me do *my* job, part of which is to help prevent
GPU hangs from happening in the first place. For that, I need useful
debugging facilities -- and so do others.

You're being *completely* unreasonable here. Even Windows(!) allows
disabling GPU recovery at runtime from software, and Windows is
usually far more developer hostile than Linux in these things.
Seriously, this level of hostility against developers coming from you
is not okay.

Yes, it's a tool that has sharp edges. That is perfectly well
understood. If we need to add warning labels then so be it. And if the
details of *how* to change the timeout or disable GPU recovery at
runtime should be changed, that too is fine. But it's an important
tool. Can we please just move forward on this in a pragmatic fashion?

Thanks,
Nicolai
