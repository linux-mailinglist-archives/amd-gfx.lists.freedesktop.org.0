We have logs somewhere, but no one yet got around to analyzing that.
Which will be quite a bit of work to do since the cloud storage is
totally disconnected from the gitlab front-end, making the connection
to which project or CI job caused something is going to require
scripting. Volunteers definitely very much welcome I think.

Uh as someone who lives the kernel multi-tree model daily, there's a
_lot_ of pain involved. I think much better to look at filtering out
CI targets for when nothing relevant happened. But that gets somewhat
tricky, since "nothing relevant" is always only relative to some
baseline, so bit of scripting and all involved to make sure you don't
run stuff too often or (probably worse) not often enough.
