Right it "shouldn't" be necessary, but I wanted to make sure that we had 
a clean (expected) slate going into device_shutdown().

Otherwise drivers might not have been prepared to go right from 
poweroff() to shutdown() callbacks.

Hmm - I guess it depends upon the failures that occurred.  I'll start 
plumbing a new message and see how it looks.

I don't "think" we can safely call dpm_suspend_end() if 
dpm_suspend_start() failed though.

Sure, I'll get a start on your feedback above and submit a fixed up 
version after the merge window.
