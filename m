Yeah might be.

If we found some older version which work. Then with git bisect we can
track which patch made this bug. But if it never work then git bisect
won't help.

You may still want to test with 5.14 as it was released today.

If that does not work then I cannot help more. It is still very
important to know if it is also broken in 5.14. Hopefully someone will
able to help you.
