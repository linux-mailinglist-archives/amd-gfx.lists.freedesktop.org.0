Thanks for the info, will take a look.

Also just to clarify, this is the first party AMD 7900 XTX, not a third par=
ty AIB (e.g. Sapphire, ASRock, etc).

lay hardware or the second SMU i2c bus. The former will require changes to =
the amdgpu display code to register display i2c buses that are not used by =
the display connectors on the board so they can be used by 3rd party applic=
ations. Currently we only register i2c buses used for display connectors. T=
he latter buses are already registered with the i2c subsystem since they ar=
e used for other things like EEPROMs on server and workstation cards and sh=
ould be available via standard Linux i2c APIs. I'm not sure what i2c LED co=
ntrollers each AIB vendor uses off hand. https://openrgb.org/index.html wou=
ld probably be a good resource for that information.
