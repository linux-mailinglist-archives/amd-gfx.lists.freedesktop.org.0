In that case I suggest to set the "don't_touch_the_hardware_any_more" 
procedure we also use in case of PCIe hotplug.

Andrey has the details but essentially it stops the driver from touching 
the hardware any more, signals all fences and unblocks everything.

It should then be trivial to inspect the hardware state and see what's 
going on, but the system will keep stable at least for SSH access.

Might be a good idea to have that mode for other fault cases like page 
faults and hardware crashes.

Christian.
