With Felix on CC you already got the right person, but he's on vacation and will not be back before the end of the year.

I can check on Monday if some people are still around which could answer a couple of questions, but in general don't expect a quick response.

Well, in general the EOP (End of Pipe) buffer contains in a ring buffer of all the events and actions the CP should execute when shaders and cache flushes finish.

The size depends on the HW generation and configuration of the GPU etc..., but don't ask me for details how that is calculated.

The point is that the size is completely unrelated to the CPU, so using PAGE_SIZE is clearly incorrect.

The problem is that the CPU must map some of the registers/resources of the GPU into the address space of the application and you run into security issues when you map more than 4k at a time.

You already mentioned MMIO remap which obviously has that problem, but if I'm not completely mistaken the PCIe doorbell BAR and some global seq counter resources will also cause problems here.

This can all be worked around by delegating those MMIO accesses into the kernel, but that means tons of extra IOCTL overhead.

Especially the cache flushes which are necessary to avoid corruption are really bad for performance in such an approach.

Not that I know off any.

Well pretty much everything, I need to double check how ROCm does HDP flushing/invalidating when the MMIO remap isn't available.

Could be that there is already a fallback path and that's the reason why this approach actually works at all.

Yeah, but this is all for ROCm and not the graphics side.

To be honest I'm not sure how ROCm even works when you have 64k pages at the moment. I would expect much more issue lurking in the kernel driver.
