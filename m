Hi Alex, first of all, thanks a lot for your detailed explanation.

I still have some other questions, see it inline.

What is the difference between GFX and Compute? Tbh, I thought they were
the same component.

I was also thinking about the concept of a pipe, and I'm trying to
define what a pipe is in this context (the word pipe is one of those
words with many meanings in computers). Is the below definition accurate
enough?

 Pipe, in the context of GFX, Compute, and SDMA, is a mechanism for
 running threads.

> pipe will switch between all of the mapped queues.  You have storage

Above, you said that each pipe will switch between queues, and a little
bit below, in your explanation about MES, you said:

 [..] If there are more MQDs than HQDs, the MES firmware will preempt
 other user queues to make sure each queue gets a time slice.

Does it mean that the GFX Pipe has the mechanic of switching queues
while MES has the scheduling logic?

Does the below example and explanation make sense?

Suppose the following scenario:
 - One pipe (pipe0) and two queues (queue[0], and queue[1]).
 - 3 MQDs (mqd[0], mqd[1], and mqd[2]).
 - pipe0 is running an user queue in queue[1].
 - pipe0 is running a kernel queue in queue[0].

Fwiu, a pipe can change the current queue in execution, but it does not
do it by itself. In other words, it has no scheduling logic; it only has
the mechanics of switching queues inside it. When the pipe switches
between queues, it uses Mid Command Buffer Preemption (MCBP), which
saves some very basic information but has no register state; in other
words, those registers must be stored in memory (MES handles it?).

In turn, MES has access to all MQDs handed over to it, which means that
MES has all the queue states available for the scheduling and
communication with the GFX pipe. Suppose that the GFX pipe is running
mqd[2] in the queue[1], and now MES wants to replace it with mqd[0]. The
communication will be something like the following:

1. MES to GFX pipe0: Replace(mqd[2], in pipe0, queue[1]) with mqd[0].
2. GFX pipe0: Just stop the current pipe, and start mqd[0].

Does it looks correct to you?

I was thinking about this register-based memory part. Does it mean that
switching between it is just a matter of updating one of those LOW and
HIGH registers?

Another question: I guess kernel queues use VMID 0, and all of the other
user queues will use a different VMID, right? Does the VMID matter for
this transition to make the kernel queue legacy?
