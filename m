But it doesn't guarantee the PASID is the right one. Suppose both the mm
has a PASID and the MSR has a VALID one, but the MSR isn't the mm one.
Then we NO-OP. So if the exception was due to us having the wrong PASID,
we stuck.

So I get that you want to set the PASID on-demand, but I find this all
really weird code to make that happen.

That's not in fact what I meant, but yes, you can take exceptions while
!IF just fine.

I don't get why you need a rdmsr here, or why not having one would
require a TIF flag. Is that because this MSR is XSAVE/XRSTOR managed?

How much more expensive is the wrmsr over the rdmsr? Can't we just
unconditionally write the current PASID and call it a day?
