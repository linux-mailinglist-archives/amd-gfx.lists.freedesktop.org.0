That's probably just a lot more stuff getting included somehow?

I'm not really sure it makes sense to even do anything other than
disabling these.

It looks like all of them are just exposed by now being able to build
PCI drivers on UML. Surely the people writing the driver didn't expect
their drivers to run over simulated PCI (which is what the UML PCI
support is all about).

Now from a PCI driver point of view you can't really tell the difference
(and anyway the driver won't be probed), but the issues (at least the
build time ones) come from having

    UML && PCI && X86_64

or

    UML && PCI && X86_32

because drivers typically depend on X86_64 or X86_32, rather than on
"X86 && X86_64" or "X86 && X86_32". In a sense thus, the issue is those
drivers don't know that "!X86 && (X86_32 || X86_64)" can happen (with
UML).


Now you could say that's the driver bug, or you could say that they
should just add "depends on !UML" (though that's basically equivalent to
adding "depends on X86" and the latter may be preferable in some cases).

Or actually in the three patches you have (1-3) it's in the code, but
same thing, you can either add && !UML (like you did) or add && X86.


Arguably, however, building PCI drivers by default is somewhat
questionable in the first place?

So maybe you should just add

    # CONFIG_UML_PCI_OVER_VIRTIO is not set

to the broken_on_uml.config since it exposes all these issues, and
really is not very useful since you're not going to actually run with
any simulated PCI devices anyway, so drivers will not be probed.
