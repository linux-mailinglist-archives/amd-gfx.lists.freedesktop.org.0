Hi Someguy,

I've been running with accelmethod=none and llvmpipe for opengl now
for over a week (more or less using only the display engine of my
rx570) and haven't experienced a single MCE during that period.
However, statistically, it will take 1-2 additional weeks to be sure
this is not a coincidence.

This seems to confirm your observations (as well as the reports in the
reddit thread) that the GPU seems to play at least some role when it
comes to the MCE caused reboots.

@John: Could it be the 3rd gen ryzen has some issues which are covered
by windows driver workarounds?
Are CPU errata data sheets publicly available?

Best regards, Clemens

PS: While it does seem to solve the reboot issue, it causes degraded
desktop performance as well as tearing when playing videos.
So I still hope I don't have to live with this forever.

PS2: AMD support respond after some delay stating the MCE actually is
caused by the watchdog timer.

About a month ago I switched back over to Linux after purchasing my 5700 XT as my initial plan was to go back to Linux. Since returning I've experienced multiple spontaneous MCE reboots. All happened while I was playing one particular game, Warcraft 3 Reforged. The MCE event is the following:

After consulting with a few friends I decided to try a different power supply to no avail. I then bit the bullet and bought a brand new 3900x. I also cleared CMOS before getting my new 3900x and after. All cpu values are on auto with no PBO or manual overclocking. The only fancy is the ram. Yesterday, after owning the new 3900x for three days, I had a MCE while I was playing Warcraft 3 Reforged. I have tested other games but none of them caused a MCE or any crashes / freezes for that matter. World of Warcraft, The Outer Worlds, Stellaris, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Both of which used, tested, and received the MCE's during those sessions. I have noticed a pattern with the MCE crashes with Warcraft 3. They always happen during a GPU load drop off or increase transition. By that I mean when exiting a match to return to the lobby, or loading a map and when it switches from the loading screen to the match itself is when these MCE's happen. The entire screen quickly turns black, everything is hard locked, and then after about a minute or so the machine reboots on its own. It hasn't happened yet while in a middle of a match session, sitting in the lobby or at the main menu screen. Its consistently been during a transition. My theory is that this could possibly be a GPU hang from switching from one power state to another power state. With the GPU hanging, causes the CPU to stall, and 
 thus a MCE. The GPU hanging could explain the quick solid black screen as well as all output is stopped. But I'm really just assuming here form my own observations from my limited understanding. Possible reason why this triggers in Warcraft is because the other games have few moments of switching power states heavily. The Outer Worlds, World of Warcraft, Stellaris, and Counter-Strike Global Offensive all keep a constant high load on the GPU and the match sessions are long.

These ones within the past year appear to all have a AMD GPU in common. I did notice a few with Intel CPU's as well paired up with a AMD GPU.
