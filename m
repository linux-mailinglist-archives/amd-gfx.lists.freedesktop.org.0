I think the ATIF method will be on the iGPU regardless of whether it's
intel or AMD.

Sorry, I'm not really an ACPI expert.  I think returning NOTIFY_BAD is
fine for this specific case, but I don't know if it will break other
platforms.  That said, I don't recall seeing any other similar bugs,
so maybe this is something specific to this particular laptop.
