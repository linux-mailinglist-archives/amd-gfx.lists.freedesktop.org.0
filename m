OK, Harry's reply cleared that up perfectly - the flexibility that's
there at the moment is about being able to reuse colorops for CRTCs in
post-blend ops (great!), not shared between planes.

Works for me: so any planes could not have colour pipelines, and the
result would be undefined (well, less defined) colour.

Nice. I guess that's kind of implicit given pre-colorop behaviour
expectations. We'd probably need a client cap analogous to universal
planes to expose planes with mandatory colorop steps. This should
probably be enforced with igt.

I'm with you on this. I think if we were trying to express a single
color-transformation block which was shared between multiple planes
(MTK is probably the closest to this conceptually from what I've
seen), having an immutable COLOR_PIPELINE_SHARED = { ids... } property
would be the best way to achieve this.

Great. But probably needs igt.

Ditto.

Plane A: COLOR_PIPELINE@123 = { 1D_CURVE@456 }
Plane B: COLOR_PIPELINE@789 = { 1D_CURVE@456 }

If userspace wasn't defensive about this, it would program the curve
for 456 twice, and unless they were the same you'd get undesirable
results.

The existing implementation is fine here, I think it just needs better
igt to codify the expectations we all have.

Yeah, again that was just not having grasped that the colorop not
being derived from the plane was actually about allowing for it to be
attached to a single CRTC instead, rather than potentially multiple
planes. I have no concerns around this.

As it stands, I've gone through the implementation pretty thoroughly,
as well as our use of it in Weston. I'm happy with how it looks for
pre-blend, and I'm even happier that the implementation is written to
apply easily to apply to post-blend CRTC pipelines.

With the suggested uAPI doc fixes and igt additions, this series is:

Thanks everyone for the immense amount of work that's gone into this. :)
