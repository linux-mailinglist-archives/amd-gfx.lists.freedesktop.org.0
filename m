Nah, Sean's series wasn't rejected. It's simply stuck waiting for review.
So if your goal is to get better dumping going on, I think combining this
with Sean's work (and getting that reviewed), plus then tapping into the
atomic state dumping code. Then you know what was requested, plus what your
atomic_check code computed should be the hw state, and you can compare
that with the register dumps you already grab.

Feels at least like a more complete and flexible solution than ad-hoc
tracepoints for debuggin in each driver. The idea behind Sean's work is
also that we'd have a blackbox recorder for any drm issues which distros
in the field could use. So driver doing their own debug output doesn't
sound super great.

I think Siqueira already chatted a bit with Sean.
