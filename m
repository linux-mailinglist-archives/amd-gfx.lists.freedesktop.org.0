I added the comment into Mesa that 0x3fff00 is the limit. I did research on
that bug separately from PAL, but I don't remember the details.

There is no performance to gain here. It's only about consistency and clear
communication to the public what the recommended SDMA programming is.

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; That&#39;s already done. See the size rest=
rictions applied to BOs and the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; callers of amdgpu_copy_buffer().<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Based on the code comments I cited, as far as =
I understand, the issue<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; is with copying the last 256 bytes of 2^22-1. =
Do I understood your<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; response correctly that you are saying that th=
e kernel isn&#39;t affected<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; by this issue because it always copies things =
that are 256 byte<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; aligned?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Yes, see the kernel always works with at least PAGE=
_SIZE buffers (between 4k and 64k depending on CPU architecture). You never=
 get anything smaller than that.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The only exception is the debugger interface, but t=
hat always copies &lt; PAGE_SIZE, so the SDMA limits are irrelevant.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; I checked the callers of amdgpu_copy_buffer an=
d can&#39;t find what you are<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; referring to. However, assuming that all calle=
rs use amdgpu_copy_buffer<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; on 256 byte aligned addresses, there is still =
an issue with large BOs:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; When the kernel copies a BO that is larger tha=
n 0x3fffe0 bytes then it<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; needs to emit multiple SDMA copy packets, and =
the copy done by the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; second packet (and other subsequent packets) w=
on&#39;t be 256 byte aligned.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I&#39;ve just double checked the documentation and =
for SI it clearly states that the limit is 0x3fffe0. Documentation for late=
r HW says 2^22 - 1 - start_addr[4:2] (which is 0x1f in the worst case so yo=
u end up with 0x3fffe0 again).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0For backward, tiled and windowed copies a 256byte b=
ounce buffer is used instead of the 32byte buffer for the linear copy. So t=
he limit is then 0x3fff00.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Looks like that buffer is also used for byte aligne=
d copies and that limit applies there as well.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; We could add another warning to amdgpu_cop=
y_buffer(), but that is<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; just the backend function.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking at the implementation of<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt; amdgpu_copy_buffer in the kernel, I se=
e that it relies on<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt; copy_max_bytes and doesn&#39;t take al=
ignment into account, so with the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt; current limit it could issue subsequen=
t copies that aren&#39;t 256 byte<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt; aligned.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; &quot;Due to HW limitation, the maximum co=
unt may not be 2^n-1, can only<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; be 2^n - 1 - start_addr[4:2]&quot;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; Well according to this comments the size r=
estriction is 32 bytes (256<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; bits!) and not 256 bytes.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;&gt; Were do you actually get the 256 bytes res=
triction from?<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; The comments I cited above are from the follow=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; According to the commit message, Dave added th=
is limit when hitting an<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; issue trying to use SDMA with buffers that are=
 larger than this.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; For SDMA v5.2 and newer, a larger limit was ad=
ded by Marek later:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; <a href=3D"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Which confirms the same issue copying the last=
 256 bytes on these<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; versions, although in this case the kernel isn=
&#39;t technically wrong<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; because it uses a smaller overall maximum.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Yeah, I mean that totally makes sense. When you wan=
t allow byte aligned copies as well then you have to use 0x3fff00 as maximu=
m.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The PAL code even has extra checks to speed up copi=
es where src and dst are byte aligned, but size isn&#39;t:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0 if (IsPow2Aligned(srcGpuAddr, sizeof(=
uint32)) &amp;&amp;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 IsPow2Aligned(dstGpuAdd=
r, sizeof(uint32)) &amp;&amp;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 (*pBytesCopied &gt;=3D =
sizeof(uint32)))<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0....<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0So it totally makes sense to use the lower limit in=
 Mesa but not for the kernel.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Regards,<br>
