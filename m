I think this is mixed up and doesn't look right to me.

First, WGP (workgroup processor) is only relevant on GFX10+ (that is,
Navi 10 or newer). CU (compute unit) is something that all GCN and RDNA
GPUs have. These are already well documented publicly, and I don't
think we need another diagram for them.

For reference, you can find a diagram of a GCN CU on page 5 here:
https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/radeon-tech-docs/instructi=
on-set-architectures/vega-7nm-shader-instruction-set-architecture.pdf
And a diagram of an RDNA WGP on page 6 here:
https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/radeon-tech-docs/instructi=
on-set-architectures/rdna4-instruction-set-architecture.pdf

The above diagrams do mention commands processors although not in
detail. As you can see, the command processors are not part of a CU.
Rather, they can generate work for the various CUs/WGPs.

As far as I understand, there is only one of each CP per queue (or per
pipe, I am somewhat mixed up myself about the differences between a
queue and a pipe). For example, each compute queue has its own MEC, and
any MEC can launch work on any CU.

Please correct me if I'm wrong about it.

Timur
