Currently the reference cooler from AMD does not have an existing RGB contr=
oller for OpenRGB, that's why I was looking for documentation on the I2C co=
mmands to send to the second SMU, so I don't risk bricking my card by sendi=
ng wrong commands during development somehow.

writeSetCMDWithData:
**************************************************************
adli2c.iSize =3D sizeof(ADLI2C)
adli2c.iAction =3D ADL_DL_I2C_ACTIONWRITE
adli2c.iAddress =3D 0xb4
adli2c.iSpeed =3D 100
0 --------------------------------------------------
Dev 0: ADL_Display_WriteAndReadSMUI2C(0, &adli2c) =3D 0
adli2c.iDataSize =3D 24
i2cData[0]~[24]
40 51 2c 01 00 00 ff 00 ff ff ff cc 00 cc 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff

From the RGB app's logs this is an example of what the official AMD applica=
tion on Windows is sending when it changes colors on the RGB strip.

From this can it be assumed the AMD card is using the latter method you men=
tioned with the second SMU I2C bus, in which case no driver changes would b=
e needed?

> It depends on the AIB/OEM and how they designed the specific board. The R=
GB controller will either be attached to the DDCVGA i2c bus on the display =
hardware or the second SMU i2c bus. The former will require changes to the =
amdgpu display code to register display i2c buses that are not used by the =
display connectors on the board so they can be used by 3rd party applicatio=
ns. Currently we only register i2c buses used for display connectors. The l=
atter buses are already registered with the i2c subsystem since they are us=
ed for other things like EEPROMs on server and workstation cards and should=
 be available via standard Linux i2c APIs. I'm not sure what i2c LED contro=
llers each AIB vendor uses off hand. https://openrgb.org/index.html would p=
robably be a good resource for that information.
