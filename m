It's been working well enough with ROCm. With user mode command 
submission there is no way to block GPU work while a TLB flush is in 
progress.

I'm aware of the potential security problem. That's why I'm recommending 
you don't actually free the memory until the TLB flush is done. So a 
bogus access will either harmlessly access memory that's not freed yet, 
or it will VM fault. It will never access memory that's already freed 
and potentially allocated by someone else.

That seems to be a limitation of your current command submission model. 
User mode command submission will not be able to trigger a TLB flush. 
Unmapping or freeing memory should be the trigger in that case.

That's how it works with KFD. That said, our TLB flushes aren't as well 
pipelined (which could probably be improved), and your strategy can 
probably batch more TLB flushes, so I see where you're coming from.

We're using heavy-weight TLB flushes on SOC15 GPUs. On Vega20 with XGMI 
we need double flushes to be safe.

I'm raising my concerns because I don't think making user mode wait is a 
good strategy long-term. And I believe this explicit sync and explicit 
VM update should be designed with an eye for future user-mode command 
submission models. If you need short-term workarounds for broken 
hardware, that's another issue. But it would be good if that could be 
kept out of the API.
