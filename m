In a perfect world ... :)

Not blaming anyone, just one of those things that happens. The
toolchains the distros (Ubuntu/Fedora) build all seem to use 128, but
possibly that's because someone told them to configure them that way at
some point.

Last summer (aka winter) is when we first discovered this issue with the
long double size being implicated.

See:
  https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/c653c591789b3acfa4bf6ae45d5af4f330e50a91

So I guess that's what prompted your patch?

Thanks.
