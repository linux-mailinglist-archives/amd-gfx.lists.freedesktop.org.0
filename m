Isn't that basically exactly what 17839856fd588 does? It looks like it
uses the same approach RDMA does by sticking FOLL_WRITE even though it
is a read action.

After that change the reamining bug is that fork can re-establish a
COW./

If you don't copy the there are data corruption bugs though. Real apps
probably don't hit a problem here as they are not forking while GUP's
are active (RDMA excluded, which does do this)

I think that implementing page pinning by blocking mmu notifiers for
the duration of the pin is a particularly good idea either, that
actually seems a lot worse than just having the pin in the first
place.

Particularly if it is only being done to avoid corner case bugs that
already afflict other GUP cases :(

Sure, that is is the 'raw' accessor
