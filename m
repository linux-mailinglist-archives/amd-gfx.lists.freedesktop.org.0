Sorry to enter mid conversation. You may want to see how the
GCC test Farm does it or the Yocto Project. I do get their different
projects but they seem to be managing fine. I'm not sure of
their funding but I do recall that a lot of the machines I use
for work on the farm are donated from IBM or some company.

Not sure if you can get a company(ies) to donate some machines
and store them in a data center like GCC or the Yocto Project,
