    Can you access the system over the network and see if there is

    It sounds like the display stack has crashed, but when the sound

            Interlaced transmits only halve the lines with each frame,

                <div>24fps is intended for video only. Anything
                  interactive at 24fps, as just moving the mouse around,
                  is extremely choppy.</div>

                <div>No way anyone would prefer that over an interlaced
                  resolution or a lower resolution. That is, by far, the

                    <br>
                    well a frame rate of 24Hz is perfectly reasonable
                    for a TV and desktop usage.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is probably caused by the TVs limited HDMI
                    bandwidth and a refresh rate of 30/25 Hz for the
                    interlaced mode isn&#39;t much better either.<br>

                            Why do you think so?, the 24Hz resolution
                            seems to be the native one of the display.<br>

                                    Maybe some miscalculation in the
                                    display code.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But apart from that if you just
                                    connected your PC to a TV I also
                                    wouldn&#39;t recommend using an
                                    interlaced resolution in the first

                                    See those resolutions only exists

                                    I think we would just disable those
                                    modes instead of searching for the
