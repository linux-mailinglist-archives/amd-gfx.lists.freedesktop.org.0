The usage is that UMDs will no longer have to wait for idle at the end of
IBs. If you have WAIT_REG_MEM or PS/CS_PARTIAL_FLUSH at the end of IBs, you
can remove that. The responsibility to sync is taken over by the kernel
driver.

This has a potential to increase performance for fullscreen applications,
because the kernel will sync only when the sync is required for
inter-process sharing, which is never for fullscreen apps.

Also if 2 or more windowed apps are rendering, there will be no longer any
sync when switching from one process to the next in the gfx ring. The sync
will only happen before the compositor starts drawing the fullscreen frame.
Therefore, the windowed apps running in parallel should run faster.

If the UMD syncs at the beginning of IBs (common e.g. with DCC fast clear),
there will be no improvement in performance. For any improvement to be
there, UMDs shouldn't sync at the beginning of IBs either, but this may not
always be possible. (a fast color clear needs a sync, while a fast Z/S
clear doesn't)
