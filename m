Because that's the one triggering the TLB flush. The issue is that 
flushing the TLB while the VMID is in use is really unreliable on most 
hardware generations.

Because it could potentially use it. When userspace lies to the kernel 
and still accesses the mapping we would allow access to freed up memory 
and create a major security problem.

Yeah, exactly that's the intention here.

See above, the future command submission is what triggers the TLB flush 
because only then we can easily execute it without to much hassle.

For Vega and Navi 2x we could use async TLB flushes and on gfx6, gfx7 
and gfx8 we could use double TLB flushes with grace time, but Navi 1x is 
so horrible broken regarding this that I don't see how else we could do 
that.
