Just my two cent, I can imagine HDMI to be used as a transport between two =
live
post-production modules. In such a use case, the driver may be programmed t=
o
save power, while in practice the user wants absolutly now loss, since thes=
e
adds up like the photocopy of the photocopy, and the studied "virtually los=
s-
less" effect is now gone.

But an opt-out solution works too.
