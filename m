Is there any separate mailing list or list of people whom we can cc
then?

If you could more elaborate on this please? I am assuming you would
anyway respond with more context / details on Patch-1 itself. If yes,
that would be great!

We aren't that familiar with the HW / SW stack here. Wanted to understand
what functionality will be unsupported due to this HW limitation then?

That's a bummer :( 
- Do we have some HW documentation around what are these limitations around non-4K pagesize? Any links to such please?
- Are there any latest AMD GPU versions which maybe lifts such restrictions?

> What we can do is to support graphics and MM, but that should already work out of the box.

So these patches helped us resolve most of the issues like SDMA hangs
and GPU kernel page faults which we saw with rocr and rccl tests with
64K pagesize. Meaning, we didn't see this working out of box perhaps
due to 64K pagesize.

AFAIU, some of these patches may require re-work based on reviews, but
at least with these changes, we were able to see all the tests passing.

Thanks a lot! That would be super helpful!

Thanks again for the quick response on the patch series.
