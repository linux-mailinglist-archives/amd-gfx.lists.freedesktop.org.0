Thanks Alex

I am now suspecting that the queue preemption issue may be related to 
the unavailability of MMIO remapping. I am not very familiar with this area.

Could you please point me to the relevant code path where the PM4 packet 
is issued to flush the HDP cache?

I am consistently able to reproduce this issue on my system when using 
more than three GPUs if patches 7/8 and 8/8 are not applied. In your 
opinion, is there anything that can be done to speed up the HDP flush or 
to avoid this situation altogether?

Those are 4k by default on modern systems as well and while over allocating them to 64k is possible that not only wastes some VRAM but can also result in OOM situations because we can't allocate the necessary page tables to switch from 2MiB to 4k pages in some cases.
