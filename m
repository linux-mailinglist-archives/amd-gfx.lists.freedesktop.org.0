For the record and everyone that lands here: the cause is known now
(it's 1958946858a62b ("drm/amd/pm: Support for getting power1_cap_min
value") [v6.7-rc1]) and the issue afaics tracked here:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3183

Other mentions:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3137
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2992

Haven't seen any statement from the amdgpu developers (now CCed) yet on
this there (but might have missed something!). From what I can see I
assume this will likely be somewhat tricky to handle, as a revert
overall might be a bad idea here. We'll see I guess.

Roman posted something that apparently was meant to go to the list, so
let me put it here:

"""
UPDATE: User fililip already posted patch, but it need to be merged,
discussion is on gitlab link below.

(PS: I hope I am replying correctly to "all" now? - using original addr.)

was getting only about 7% less performance but 90W(!) less consumption
when set to my 115W before. Also I wonder if we as a OS of options and
freedom have to stick to such very high reference for min values without
ability to override them through some sys ctrls. Commit was done by amd
guy and I wonder if because of maybe this post that I made few months
ago(business strategy?):

or reference values here either, just a move to lower the range of
options for whatever reason.

And while at it, let me add this issue to the tracking as well

[TLDR: I'm adding this report to the list of tracked Linux kernel
regressions; the text you find below is based on a few templates
paragraphs you might have encountered already in similar form.
See link in footer if these mails annoy you.]

Thanks for the report. To be sure the issue doesn't fall through the
cracks unnoticed, I'm adding it to regzbot, the Linux kernel regression
tracking bot:

#regzbot introduced 1958946858a62b /
#regzbot title drm: amdgpu: under-powering broke

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
