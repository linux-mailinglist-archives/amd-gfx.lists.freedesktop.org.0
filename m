Thanks for the pointer.
That's one monster ioctl. So much copy_from_user.
BPF prog would need to be sleepable to able to examine the args in such depth.
After quick glance at the code I would put a new hook into
kfd_ioctl() right before
retcode = func(filep, process, kdata);
At this point kdata is already copied from user space 
and usize, that is cmd specific, is known.
So bpf prog wouldn't need to copy that data again.
That will save one copy.
To drill into details of kfd_ioctl_set_cu_mask() the prog would
need to be sleepable to do second copy_from_user of cu_mask.
At least it's not that big.
Yes, the attachment point will be amd driver specific,
but the program doesn't need to be.
It can be generic tracing prog that is agumented to use BTF.
Something like writeable tracepoint with BTF support would do.
So on the bpf side there will be minimal amount of changes.
And in the driver you'll add one or few writeable tracepoints
and the result of the tracepoint will gate
retcode = func(filep, process, kdata);
call in kfd_ioctl().
The writeable tracepoint would need to be cgroup-bpf based.
So that's the only tricky part. BPF infra doesn't have
cgroup+tracepoint scheme. It's probably going to be useful
in other cases like this. See trace_nbd_send_request.
