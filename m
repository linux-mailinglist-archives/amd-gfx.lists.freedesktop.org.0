It's been a while since I paged any of this code into my head, but I
believe the actual workload message in the SMU is a mask where you can
specify multiple workload types at the same time and the SMU will
arbitrate between them internally.  E.g., the most aggressive one will
be selected out of the ones specified.  I think in the driver we just
set one bit at a time using the current interface.  It might be better
to change the interface and just ref count the hint types and then
when we call the set function look at the ref counts for each hint
type and set the mask as appropriate.
