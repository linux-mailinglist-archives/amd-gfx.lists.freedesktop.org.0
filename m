Mission acomplished, we've gone full circle, and the totally-not-a-gpu
driver is now trying to use gpu infrastructure. And seems to have
gained vram meanwhile too. Next up is going to be synchronization
using dma_fence so you can pass buffers back&forth without stalls
among drivers.

Bonus points for this being at v3 before it shows up on dri-devel and
cc's dma-buf folks properly (not quite all, I added the missing
people).

I think we roughly have two options here

a) Greg continues to piss off dri-devel folks while trying to look
cute&cuddly and steadfastly claiming that this accelator doesn't work
like any of the other accelerator drivers we have in drivers/gpu/drm.
All while the driver ever more looks like one of these other accel
drivers.

b) We finally do what we should have done years back and treat this as
a proper driver submission and review it on dri-devel instead of
sneaking it in through other channels because the merge criteria
dri-devel has are too onerous and people who don't have experience
with accel stacks for the past 20 years or so don't like them.

"But this probably means a new driver and big disruption!"

Not my problem, I'm not the dude who has to come up with an excuse for
this because I didn't merge the driver in the first place. I do get to
throw a "we all told you so" in though, but that's not helping.

Also I'm wondering which is the other driver that we share buffers
with. The gaudi stuff doesn't have real struct pages as backing
storage, it only fills out the dma_addr_t. That tends to blow up with
other drivers, and the only place where this is guaranteed to work is
if you have a dynamic importer which sets the allow_peer2peer flag.
Adding maintainers from other subsystems who might want to chime in
here. So even aside of the big question as-is this is broken.

Currently only 2 drivers set allow_peer2peer, so those are the only
ones who can consume these buffers from device memory. Pinging those
folks specifically.

Doug/Jason from infiniband: Should we add linux-rdma to the dma-buf
wildcard match so that you can catch these next time around too? At
least when people use scripts/get_maintainers.pl correctly. All the
other subsystems using dma-buf are on there already (dri-devel,
linux-media and linaro-mm-sig for android/arm embedded stuff).

Cheers, Daniel
