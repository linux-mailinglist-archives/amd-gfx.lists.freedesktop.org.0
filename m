We are actually trying to move away from that model.  drm started out
as a midlayer and it caused all kinds of pain.  E.g., some drm devices
are usb devices, some are pci, some are platform devices, etc.  A flow
that worked for one didn't always work well for another.  In general
we should follow the driver model for the specific device model of
your driver and then use drm helper functions to deal with the core
drm functionality.  E.g., drm shouldn't be in the business of dealing
with pci power management.  The driver should interact directly with
the pci subsystem for that.
