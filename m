Hello!

Registration & Call for Proposals are now open for XDC 2024, which will
take place at the Concordia University Conference Centre in Montr=C3=A9al,
Canada on October 9 to 11.=20

New this year: XDC 2024 will feature two full days dedicated to talks
followed by a day dedicated to workshops, meetings & hacking.
All workshops and meetings will take place on the last day.

    https://xdc2024.x.org
  =20
As usual, the conference is free of charge and open to the general
public. If you plan on attending, please make sure to register as early
as possible!
=20
In order to register as attendee, you will therefore need to register
via the XDC website.

    https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/6/registrations/

In addition to registration, the CfP is now open for talks, workshops
and demos at XDC 2024. While any serious proposal will be gratefully
considered, topics of interest to X.Org and freedesktop.org developers
are encouraged. The program focus is on new development, ongoing
challenges and anything else that will spark discussions among
attendees in the hallway track.

We are open to talks across all layers of the graphics stack, from the
kernel to desktop environments / graphical applications and about how
to make things better for the developers who build them. Head to the
CfP page to learn more:

    https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/6/abstracts/

The deadline for submissions Monday, 12 August 2024.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Montr=C3=A9al! If you have any
questions,
please send me an email (mfilion at collabora.com),
adding on CC the X.org board (board at foundation.x.org).

And don't forget, you can follow us on Mastodon for all the latest
updates and to stay connected:

Best,

Mark
