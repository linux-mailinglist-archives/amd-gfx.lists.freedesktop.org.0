It's probably better to use 0x3fff00 to match Mesa and PAL. There is no
benefit in using a different limit, not even a perf benefit, and it's
better to be consistent with all UMDs.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Christian,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The kernel and Mesa disagree on the limits for almost all SDMA=
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; versions, so it would be nice to actually understand what the<=
br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; limits of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the SDMA HW are and use the same limit in the kernel and Mesa,=
 or<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; if<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that isn&#39;t viable, let&#39;s document why the different li=
mits make<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; sense.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m adding Marek to CC, he wrote the comment that I refere=
nced<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; here.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as I understand from my conversation with Marek, the ke=
rnel<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually wrong.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; If the limits depend on alignment, then we should either set a=
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; limit<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is always safe, or make sure SDMA copies in the kernel ar=
e<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; always<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; aligned and add assertions about it.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s already done. See the size restrictions applied to BOs =
and the<br>
&gt;&gt; callers of amdgpu_copy_buffer().<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Based on the code comments I cited, as far as I understand, the issue<=
br>
&gt; is with copying the last 256 bytes of 2^22-1. Do I understood your<br>
&gt; response correctly that you are saying that the kernel isn&#39;t affec=
ted<br>
&gt; by this issue because it always copies things that are 256 byte<br>
&gt; aligned?<br>
<br>
Yes, see the kernel always works with at least PAGE_SIZE buffers (between 4=
k and 64k depending on CPU architecture). You never get anything smaller th=
an that.<br>
<br>
The only exception is the debugger interface, but that always copies &lt; P=
AGE_SIZE, so the SDMA limits are irrelevant.<br>
<br>
&gt; I checked the callers of amdgpu_copy_buffer and can&#39;t find what yo=
u are<br>
&gt; referring to. However, assuming that all callers use amdgpu_copy_buffe=
r<br>
&gt; on 256 byte aligned addresses, there is still an issue with large BOs:=
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; When the kernel copies a BO that is larger than 0x3fffe0 bytes then it=
<br>
&gt; needs to emit multiple SDMA copy packets, and the copy done by the<br>
&gt; second packet (and other subsequent packets) won&#39;t be 256 byte ali=
gned.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve just double checked the documentation and for SI it clearly states=
 that the limit is 0x3fffe0. Documentation for later HW says 2^22 - 1 - sta=
rt_addr[4:2] (which is 0x1f in the worst case so you end up with 0x3fffe0 a=
gain).<br>
<br>
For backward, tiled and windowed copies a 256byte bounce buffer is used ins=
tead of the 32byte buffer for the linear copy. So the limit is then 0x3fff0=
0.<br>
<br>
Looks like that buffer is also used for byte aligned copies and that limit =
applies there as well.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; We could add another warning to amdgpu_copy_buffer(), but that is<=
br>
&gt;&gt; just the backend function.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking at the implementation of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; amdgpu_copy_buffer in the kernel, I see that it relies on<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; copy_max_bytes and doesn&#39;t take alignment into account, so=
 with the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; current limit it could issue subsequent copies that aren&#39;t=
 256 byte<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; aligned.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Due to HW limitation, the maximum count may not be 2^n-1, ca=
n only<br>
&gt;&gt; be 2^n - 1 - start_addr[4:2]&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Well according to this comments the size restriction is 32 bytes (=
256<br>
&gt;&gt; bits!) and not 256 bytes.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Were do you actually get the 256 bytes restriction from?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The comments I cited above are from the following sources:<br>

&gt; The limit in Mesa was added by this commit:<br>

95004232ed</a><br>
&gt; According to the commit message, Dave added this limit when hitting an=
<br>
&gt; issue trying to use SDMA with buffers that are larger than this.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For SDMA v5.2 and newer, a larger limit was added by Marek later:<br>

&gt; Which confirms the same issue copying the last 256 bytes on these<br>
&gt; versions, although in this case the kernel isn&#39;t technically wrong=
<br>
&gt; because it uses a smaller overall maximum.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I mean that totally makes sense. When you want allow byte aligned cop=
ies as well then you have to use 0x3fff00 as maximum.<br>
<br>
The PAL code even has extra checks to speed up copies where src and dst are=
 byte aligned, but size isn&#39;t:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 if (IsPow2Aligned(srcGpuAddr, sizeof(uint32)) &amp;&amp;<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 IsPow2Aligned(dstGpuAddr, sizeof(uint32)) &amp;=
&amp;<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 (*pBytesCopied &gt;=3D sizeof(uint32)))<br>
....<br>
<br>
So it totally makes sense to use the lower limit in Mesa but not for the ke=
rnel.<br>
<br>

Christian.<br>
