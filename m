If you see my last reply, Since Alex's last message, we are very clear 
on this point. And also as PM FW is already picking up the one with the 
highest priority, we don't have to worry about blocking profile change 
calls via different contexts. In this way, every job will be executed at 
at-least the requested priority power profile, or more than that.

current power profile P0.
Job1 came, requested power profile P2=> PM FW changed profile to P2.
Job2 came, requested power profile P3=> if (p3 > p2): profile changed to 
P3, else it will stay at P2. So Job2 will still execute at P2, which is 
more aggressive than P3.

So we don't have to block the PP change request at all.

Yes, I had seen this API and its high level API while I was exploring 
the code, and I found this written to support sysfs based reads and 
write, and is not useful for a context based scenario.

Same as above, this sysfs interface is very basic, and good for 
validation of power profile change, but not for job level pp change.

I still don't understand how does this series handle and change this 
mask ? This part is still being done in 
amdgpu_dpm_switch_power_profile() function, which is a dpm function 
only. Code in this series is just calling/consuming this function from 
the scheduler.

As mentioned above, we are just consuming 
amdgpu_dpm_switch_power_profile() function. So if this function is valid 
for all these ASICs, I think this wrapper will also be fine.
