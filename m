So doing some googling finds a patch from Dan that claims to hand EFI
special purpose memory to the device dax driver.  But when I try to
follow the version that got merged it looks it is treated simply as an
MMIO region to be claimed by drivers, which would not get a struct page.

Dan, did I misunderstand how E820_TYPE_SOFT_RESERVED works?

Ok, so you want to migrate to and from them.  Not use DEVICE_PUBLIC
for the actual page cache pages.  That maks a lot more sense.

So yes.  It is a Memory Mapped I/O region, which unlike the PCIe BARs
that people typically deal with is fully cache coherent.  I think this
does make more sense as a description.

But to go back to what start this discussion:  If these are memory
mapped I/O pfn_valid should generally not return true for them.

And as you already pointed out in reply to Alex we need to tighten the
selection criteria one way or another.
