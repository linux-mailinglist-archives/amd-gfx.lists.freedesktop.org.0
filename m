But the microcontroller doesn't really know user-intent, and can't
really predict the future, which is the reason why a lot of OSes still
have power profile selection knobs.

So I'm mostly wondering whether:
- those clock ramping transitions could be a problem on heavy workloads
with varying intensity, say stuttering in a game that needs to be able
to go from simple to really complicated in short order
- setting the minimum clock would avoid short bursts of activity
clocking up then down (in a GPU-based desktop environment for example),
thus reducing the battery life

I would indeed expect "automatic" to work as expected, but not always
be what the user intends for the GPU to be doing.
