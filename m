Yes, I know what the max bpc property does. I do not think it defines
a fixed bpc the driver was required to use, as if it did, the link bpc
property would be useless.

Yes it is? It requests an upper limit for BPC and every driver
will try to pick the highest that's practically possible.

imately be lower.

I am aware, that is why the link bpc property is added, to evaluate
what the driver ended up picking. See "practically possible" above.

n a spurious issue report.

That is not what any of this is used for. In the MR, it acts on the weston
option of the name max-bpc, which incidentally sets the max bpc
property, but is an explicit request by a user made through a config
file. The use here is just a basic userspace use of it, the point is
not to create a new warning out of nothing for the fun of it.

The whole point of this property is to close the feedback loop
between requesting a new bpc with max-bpc and seeing what comes out
the other end with link-bpc. This answers all questions you should
have about the definition of what bits per component is (same as
with max bpc), and why this property should exist. "Someone might
not understand its purpose" is, in my eyes, not a valid reason to
not have this property, as this argument applies to every property.
