This setting does not introduce stability problems or bugs. 
Voltage/frequency ratio is dynamic relative to power cap, GPU auto 
adjust to it. This is not like lowering voltage alone. By lowering GPU 
power, it simply auto-adjust its frequency and voltage on the fly and 
remain stable without crashes. If you lower power way too far, GPU flip 
to maximum power usage on its own, as reported. So both lower than 
vendors are not as undefined as it seems and safety checks are done 
outside vendors range as well.

As for maintenance, patch is literally single "if" switch and a boot 
option.

Idea that you spare yourself extra trouble from reports by not 
implementing this is also false. If this patch is not implemented, I can 
say with confidence that people will end up patching their kernels(I 
know I would) due to how much power can this option save. It is way too 
important. You will still end up with reports, only this time without 
even be aware of the patch because it will be unofficial, "in-house" 
made. And probably forget this thing even existed later on. You also 
introduce extra work to the users, it will not be simple "pacman -Syu" 
anymore, but hassle of whole kernel setup, patching and recompilation on 
the user's side.
