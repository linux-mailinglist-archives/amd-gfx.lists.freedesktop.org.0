Thank you for elaborating on this. I guess I mixed up Chrome OS and 
gamescope, and was especially confused, the commit message of commit 
ddab8bd788f5 not explicitly listing the problematic userspace. Despite 
the commit message being well written, this crucial information is missing.

Yes, it does. Thank you very much for taking the time for walking me 
through this.
