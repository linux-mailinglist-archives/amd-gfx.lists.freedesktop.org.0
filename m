I have told that as the kernel in Debian 11.

I keep talking that only for understanding the problem depth and not for 
fixing that in 4 kernels!

That is, there can be simpler to apply that workaround.

OK, ask.

We talk about different variants, and the hanging I saw also on one 6 
kernel just after installing Debian 13 and that is why #1118349 I opened 
about the hanging but not rebooting in the initial report #879992.

I have resolved the problem for myself far ago.

To help for other with same hardware, since I can fix that for myself if 
I need.

Whether I don't provide you all information beyond "get my hand in the 
dirty"? :)

So, English isn't native one for you? :)
