I don't think there is any delay in that loop is there?

	while (!dma_fence_is_signaled(fence) &&
	       ktime_to_ns(ktime_sub(deadline, ktime_get())) > 0)
		ring->funcs->soft_recovery(ring, vmid);

(soft_recovery function does not have a delay/sleep/whatever either)

FWIW, two other changes we did in SteamOS to make recovery more reliable 
on VANGOGH was:

1) Move the timeout determination after the spinlock setting the fence 
error.

2) Raise the timeout from 0.1s to 1s.
