I'm not entirely sure on the relative levels of aggression, but I
believe the SMU priorities them by index.  E.g.
#define WORKLOAD_PPLIB_DEFAULT_BIT        0
#define WORKLOAD_PPLIB_FULL_SCREEN_3D_BIT 1
#define WORKLOAD_PPLIB_POWER_SAVING_BIT   2
#define WORKLOAD_PPLIB_VIDEO_BIT          3
#define WORKLOAD_PPLIB_VR_BIT             4
#define WORKLOAD_PPLIB_COMPUTE_BIT        5
#define WORKLOAD_PPLIB_CUSTOM_BIT         6

3D < video < VR < compute < custom

VR and compute are the most aggressive.  Custom takes preference
because it's user customizable.
