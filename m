Or you tell the HW to continue at the place you stopped excuting and before the reset and use the conditional execute all jobs are wrapped up in anyway to determine if they should execute or not or overwrite the commands with NOPs when for engines who don't use the conditional execute.

Re-emitting the command stream would only be necessary if we need to change the commands in anyway, and even if we would need to do that then I would say that we should not emit the commands again at all.

I have patches in the pipeline to remove the job object from the reset path, so that we can free it up directly after submission again and completely solve all the lifetime issues we had with that.

Re-emitting completely breaks that again.
