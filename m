 data (and in case of an APU also the CPU data) from it (these are the valu=

card*/device/gpu_metrics" exists, it will not use the data provided by hwmo=
n (/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/*).

 "https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/includ=
e/kgd_pp_interface.h#L725". For my CPU/APU the 'gpu_metrics_v2_1' structure=
 is used (I tested this by reading the gpu_metrics file myself). Furthermor=
e, I think that for my case, this structure is set by the function "https:/=
/elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/pm/swsmu/smu13/=
smu_v13_0_5_ppt.c#L459" but I am not completely sure about this.

The metrics provided by the SMU firmware varies from asic to asic.
For things that are not supported by the metrics table for a
particular asic, those fields would be 0.  You can see what metrics
are supported for your asic in smu_v13_0_5_get_gpu_metrics() as that
function populates the supported fields from the firmware to the
common structure.  current_gfxclk is not supported in your asic, but
average_gfxclk_frequency is.  So you'd want to use whichever field is
available for a particular asic in Mangohud.

Yes, that is the right link.  umr uses the same interface as mangohud,
so you should see the same data.
