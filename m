Just a small update. I have CR negotiation working now.
I have found out what I suspected. Although the amdgpu driver has code
in it that looks like CR negotiation is implemented, it does not
actually do any negotiation at all.
I still have some work to do, to also get EQ negotiation working.
Once I have a patch that is tidy enough, I will raise a bug request
and attach the patch to it.
I am just pleased that this is a software problem, and not my screen at fau=
lt.

Someone mentioned that the amdgpu driver is DP compliance tested
periodically. In short, I don't think any of those Link negotiation DP
compliance tests are actually valid, based on what I have found, so it
might be sensible for the person who runs the Link negotiation DP
compliance test suite to double check it is actually doing its job.

Summary:  During CR negotiation, it only ever outputs a swing of 0,
and never 1,2 or 3 as it should.
So, my guess is only Screens on relatively short cables have ever
worked with the Linux amdgpu driver.
Although longer cables might work for some, it probably gets a bit hit
and miss for them.

Kind Regards

James
