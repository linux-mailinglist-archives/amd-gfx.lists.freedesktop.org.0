Not sure why you think we optimize anything here?

Not sure about your hw, but at least on intel replaying tends to just
result in follow-on fun. And that holds even more so the more complex a
workload is. This is why vk just dies immediately and does not try to
replay anything, offloading it to the app. Same with arb robusteness.
Afaik it's really only media and classic gl which insist that the driver
stack somehow recover.

And recovering from a mess in userspace is a lot simpler than trying to
pull of the same magic in the kernel. Plus it also helps with a few of the
dma_fence rules, which is a nice bonus.
