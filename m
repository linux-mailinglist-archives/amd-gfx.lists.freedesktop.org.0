As a generic compositor author, it's pretty important for me to
understand what happens when trying to access protected content. Does
the import simply fail? Does it sample rubbish? Does my context
killed? etc.

I don't really see what the problem is, but it would've been nice if
it was at least attempted, rather than just parachuted in ... I know
I'm going to end up getting bug reports about it for Wayland/Weston,
and then all of a sudden it's become my problem that this was just
dropped in as a vendor-specific feature in a vendor-specific island.

Cheers,
Daniel
