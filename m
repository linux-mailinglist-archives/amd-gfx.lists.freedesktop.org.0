@Christian Koenig
Any objections to this?  I realize that fixing the OOM killer is
ultimately the right approach, but I don't really see how this makes
things worse.  The current scheme is biased towards dGPUs as they have
lots of on board memory so on dGPUs we can end up setting gtt size to
3/4 of system memory already in a lot of cases since there is often as
much vram as system memory.  Due to the limits in ttm, we can't use
more than half at the moment anway, so this shouldn't make things
worse on dGPUs and would help a lot of APUs.  Once could make the
argument that with more vram there is less need for gtt so less chance
for OOM, but I think it is more of a scale issue.  E.g., on dGPUs
you'll generally be running higher resolutions and texture quality,
etc. so the overall memory footprint is just scaled up.
