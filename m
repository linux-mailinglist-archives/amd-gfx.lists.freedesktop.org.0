Ah, I see. So the reason why we need to draw the cursor twice is to
accomodate for the case where it's visible on both the primary and
overlay planes, e.g.

Is that right?

In the case where the cursor only intersects a single plane (either primary
or overlay) we need to draw it once only.

Since some KMS user-space (ChromeOS) uses the non-atomic cursor with the re=
st
of the atomic API, we need to always ensure that the cursor can be enabled =
at
any time, even if it's currently disabled.

(1) and (2) are correct, but (3) is not. My overlay plane isn't scaled, but=
 my
primary plane may be. That doesn't change the outcome: the unscaled cursor =
can
be painted onto the overlay pipe, but not onto the primary pipe.

KMS has a standard "zpos" property [1], which may be mutable. So we could i=
n
theory set an immutable "zpos" for the primary plane and overlay plane, and
allow user-space to change the "zpos" of the cursor plane to move it
in-between.

But for my use-case, I need the cursor plane to be painted on top of the
overlay, so it'd only be useful when the cursor doesn't intersect the overl=
ay.

My use-case actually falls under both (1) and (2). We want to leave as much
bandwidth as possible for the game to use. We want to save power because we=
're
running on battery.

We don't _require_ KMS planes to run, we have a fallback composition path w=
hich
uses the compute queue. But we want to do as much as possible to use KMS pl=
anes.
