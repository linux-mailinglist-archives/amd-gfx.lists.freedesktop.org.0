That's not only a preference, but a must have. Otherwise the code maybe 
won't work as expected on 32bit architectures.

No, that the hmm range depends on the address space bits of the CPU is 
perfectly correct. Essentially this is just an userspace address range.

Our problem here is that this code needs to work on both 32bit and 64bit 
systems. And on a 32bit system limiting the types wouldn't work 
correctly as far as I can see.

So the compiler is complaining for rather good reasons and by using 
"min_t(UL" we just hide that instead of fixing the problem.

I suggest to use "min_t(u64" instead. An intelligent compiler should 
even be capable of optimizing this away by looking at the input types on 
32bit archs.

I think just changing this to 1UL should be sufficient.
