It's for the GALLIUM HUD.

The only missing thing is the size of all evicted VRAM allocations, and the
size of all evicted visible VRAM allocations.

1. No list is exposed. Only sums of buffer sizes are exposed. Also, the
eviction list has no meaning here. All lists are treated equally, and
mem_type is compared with preferred_domains to determine where buffers are
and where they should be.

2. I'm not interested in the overcommit value. I'm only interested in
knowing the number of bytes of evicted VRAM right now. It can be as
variable as the CPU load, but in practice it shouldn't be because PCIe
doesn't have the bandwidth to move things quickly.

3. Yes, that's true.

Marek
