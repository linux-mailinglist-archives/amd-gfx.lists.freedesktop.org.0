Hi Alex, Timur,

I attempted to incorporate all the points from the discussion into the
version of the text below. The main points are:

1. Added a link to the CU image.
1. Removed the reference to CP from the micro-schedules part.
3. Rewrite the last paragraph just to mention components like CPG, CPC,
etc.

Let me know what you think.

New version:

.. kernel-figure:: cu.svg
===> https://people.igalia.com/siqueira/kernel-doc-imgs/cu.svg

First of all, note that the GC can have multiple SEs, depending on the specific
GPU/APU, and each SE has multiple Compute Units (CU). From the diagram, you can
see that CUs have a block named Schedulers. The reason the name is in plural is
because this hardware block is a combination of different micro-schedules: CPF,
CPC, and CPG.

The component that acts as the front end between the CPU and the GPU is called
CP (Command Processor). This component is responsible for providing greater
flexibility to the GC since CP makes it possible to program various aspects of
the GPU pipeline. CP also coordinates the communication between the CPU and GPU
via a mechanism named **Ring Buffers**, where the CPU appends information to
the buffer while the GPU removes operations. Finally, CP is also responsible
for handling Indirect Buffers (IB).

After CP completes the first set of processing, which includes separate command
packets specific to GFX and Compute, other blocks step in. For reference,
internally the CP consists of several sub-blocks (CPC - CP compute, CPG - CP
graphics, and CPF - CP fetcher).  Some of these acronyms appear in register
names, but this is more of an implementation detail and not something that
directly impacts driver programming or debugging directly.

Thanks
