I think Harry hasn't answered your proposition. I must say that the 
first time I looked for VGA in the legacy code, I stumbled upon the RGB 
usage. But then, it began to make sense (I'm not completely sure if 
signals and connector types are used properly everywhere), because we 
are mostly translating DRM signal types to supported connector 
types.That being said, while both dc_is_rgb_signal() and 
dc_is_analog_signal() could be used here, we are specifically querying 
the signal type and this signal type is RGB. Because of this, I would be 
in favor of keeping dc_is_rgb_signal() unless there is another analog 
type that could be queried and not rename SIGNAL_TYPE_RGB to 
SIGNAL_TYPE_ANALOG in any case. Cheers, Alexandre >>
