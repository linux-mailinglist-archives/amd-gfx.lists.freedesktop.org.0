Nah, this was a brand new card I bought on launch day from a reputable 
brick-and-mortar.

Since I was getting to the end of my 30-day return window, I decided to 
just take the card back and exchange it for an RX 560 -- the only other 
card comparable in price that was also in stock (thanks miners/scalpers!).

When I got that card home and tried it out, it had the same problem. From 
there, I decided to take a break and try a different approach. First thing 
I wanted to try was stepping through the different BIOS revisions 
available for my motherboard to see if that made any difference.

That's when I saw ASRock had a beta for the next BIOS release available 
for testing. Flashed it, configured the BIOS to my liking, and incredibly, 
no resets or crashes.

I've been under the weather for several days so I'm just now getting back 
to testing things again, but so far, everything seems to be good.

I do wish I could have gotten to this point a little sooner. Exchanging my 
overpriced brand new GPU for an overpriced 5 year old GPU is a little 
stomach turning :-/
