So for the AMDGPU subsystem, as the only result is a comment, currently, 
conditionals with omitted operands are not used. So, it’s a valid 
question, if the use should be introduced into the subsystem.

The GCC documentation also states:

So, in your case, there are no side effect, if I am not mistaken.

I do not care, if the extension is going to be used or not. The 
maintainers might want to officially confirm the use in the subsystem, 
as using these extensions is surprising for some C developers not 
knowing the GNU extensions.

In my opinion, asking this on the list is perfectly valid, as other 
readers, might have the same question. But being more elaborate to avoid 
misunderstandings is always a good thing.

I hope, you like my solution without using find. ;-)


Kind regards,
