I just wanted to say that the non-AMD-display bits of this patch were 
tested by me and seem to have fixed a problem I'd had where if I had an 
NFS share mounted on suspend/hibernate, that ~50% of the time when 
resuming the machine would be up, but disk I/O would be deadlocked (so I 
really couldn't do anything except SysRq-S/U/B).

Still going to test a few more suspend/resume/hibernate cycles, but it 
does seem to have fixed that issue for me. There was a corresponding 
patch in linux-pm earlier along the same lines, but that one only had a 
limited success rate.

I have "hybrid sleep" enabled, where systemd will go into full 
hibernation after 4 hrs, BTW.
