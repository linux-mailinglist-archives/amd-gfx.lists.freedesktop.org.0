Thanks. This is necessary as the mbi-alias provides an imperfect
implementation of the ITS and causes certain PCIe cards (eg x520 Intel
10G NIC) to misbehave.

Part of the ITS bug is it expects to be cache coherent with the CPU
cluster by design.
Due to the rk356x being implemented without an outer accessible cache,
the ITS and other devices that require cache coherency (PCIe for
example) crash in fun ways.
This means that rk356x cannot implement a specification compliant ITS or PC=
Ie.
From the rk3588 source dump it appears it was produced without an
outer accessible cache, which means if true it also will be unable to
use any PCIe cards that implement cache coherency as part of their
design.
