Thanks Alex.

That sounds as if it would make sense for me to try to submit a patch to
you that restricts this limitation to DCE 11.0 only?

All i can say is during my testing with DCE-8.3 over HDMI and DCE-11.2 over
DP under amdvlk with fp16 mode and ouptut_bpc set to 10 bpc, ie. dithering
down from 12 bpc to 10 bpc, i didn't notice any problems when hacking this
out, and photometer measurements showed good improvements of luminance
reproduction with dithering.

and just never updated or the changes were accidentally lost when we

Mine does ;-). As does apparently the Kodi media player. And at least
Gnome/X11 works now, whereas KDE's Kwin/X11 used to work nicely, but
regressed. And amdvlk does have fp16 support now since a while ago, so
that's one way to get high precision without disturbing conventional
desktop apps. I'll probably look into Mesa's Vulkan/WSI for 10 bpc / fp16
sometime this year if nobody beats me to it.
