Okay, this is perfect and I think you just put me on the right track
for identifying the exact issue. Thanks!

I've sliced up the non-prefetchable window and given it a prefetchable window.
The 256MB BAR now resides in that window.
However I'm still getting bus errors, so it seems the prefetch isn't
actually happening.
The difference is now the GPU realizes that an error has happened and
initiates recovery, vice before where it seemed to be clueless.
If I understand everything correctly, that's because before the bus
error was raised by the CPU due to the memory flag, vice now where
it's actually the bus raising the alarm.

My next question, is this something the driver should set and isn't,
or is it just because of the broken cache coherency?
