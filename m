Thank you, Alex.

We were encountering an issue while running the RCCL unit tests. With 2 
GPUs, all tests passed successfully; however, when running with more 
than 2 GPUs, the tests began to fail at random points with the following 
errors:

[  598.576821] amdgpu 0048:0f:00.0: amdgpu: Queue preemption failed for 
queue with doorbell_id: 80030008
[  606.696820] amdgpu 0048:0f:00.0: amdgpu: Failed to evict process queues
[  606.696826] amdgpu 0048:0f:00.0: amdgpu: GPU reset begin!. Source: 4
[  610.696852] amdgpu 0048:0f:00.0: amdgpu: Queue preemption failed for 
queue with doorbell_id: 80030008
[  610.696869] amdgpu 0048:0f:00.0: amdgpu: Failed to evict process queues
[  610.696942] amdgpu 0048:0f:00.0: amdgpu: Failed to restore process queues


After applying patches 7/8 and 8/8, we are no longer seeing this issue.

One question I have is: we only started observing this problem when the 
number of GPUs increased. Could this be related to MMIO remapping not 
being available?

Those are 4k by default on modern systems as well and while over allocating them to 64k is possible that not only wastes some VRAM but can also result in OOM situations because we can't allocate the necessary page tables to switch from 2MiB to 4k pages in some cases.
