To be clear: we need this. I've argued before that we need a min bpc
setting because we'd rather not enable HDR if we can't get the bit
depth required for it and there is no other mechanism to control this.
The other remaining kernel problem for HDR is that we still have no
control over YCC/RGB selection on the cable and thus can't choose the
correct color space infoframe.
