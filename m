This is the same as with Intel/i915. Fdinfo is not intended to provide 
utilisation of EUs and such, just how busy are the "entities" kernel 
submits to. So doing something like in this series would make the 
reporting more similar between the two drivers.

I think both the 0-800% or 0-100% range (taking 8 ring compute as an 
example) can be misleading for different workloads. Neither <800% in the 
former means one can send more work and same for <100% in the latter.

There is also a parallel with the CPU world here and hyper threading, if 
not wider, where "What does 100% actually mean?" is also wishy-washy.

Also note that the reporting of actual time based values in fdinfo would 
not changing with this series.

Of if you can guide me towards how to distinguish real vs fake 
parallelism in HW IP blocks I could modify the series to only add 
capacity tags where there are truly independent blocks. That would be 
different from i915 though were I did not bother with that distinction. 
(For reasons that assignment of for instance EUs to compute "rings" 
(command streamers in i915) was supposed to be possible to re-configure 
on the fly. So it did not make sense to try and be super smart in fdinfo.)

The part I do not understand is the purpose of the ring argument in for 
instance drm_amdgpu_cs_chunk_ib. It appears userspace can create up to N 
scheduling entities using different ring id's, but internally they can 
map to 1:N same scheduler instances (depending on IP type, can be that 
each userspace ring maps to same N hw rings, or for rings with no drm 
sched load balancing userspace ring also does not appear to have a 
relation to the picked drm sched instance.).

So I neither understand how this ring is useful, or how it does not 
create a problem for IP types which use drm_sched_pick_best. It appears 
even if userspace created two scheduling entities with different ring 
ids they could randomly map to same drm sched aka same hw ring, no?
