Dear Bokun,
  drm/amd/amdgpu: Update PF2VF header

Thank you for rerolling the patch. Please add the iteration/version in 
the subject next time `[PATCH v2 1/2]` or so.

Please use that as the commit message summary, and the subject/summary 
as the title for the cover letter? Maybe:

drm/amd/amdgpu: Properly indent PF2VF header
