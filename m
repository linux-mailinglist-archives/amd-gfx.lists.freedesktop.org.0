GTT BOs could be evicted if we're out of GTT space, though that's very 
unlikely. We usually use GTT BOs for things that need to be mapped in 
kernel mode (e.g. signal pages), which means they are pinned and they 
won't be evicted.

But the same DMABuf attachment mechanism is also used for VRAM, which 
can be evicted. We need a common solution that will prevent unnecessary 
evictions with VRAM mapped on PCIe P2P multi-GPU systems.
