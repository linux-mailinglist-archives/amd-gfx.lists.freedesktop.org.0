s/gitlab credits/GCP credits/

I took a quick look at HPE, which we previously used for bare metal,
and it looks like we'd be spending $25-50k (depending on how much
storage you want to provision, how much room you want to leave to
provision more storage later, how much you care about backups) to run
a similar level of service so that'd put a bit of a dint in your
year-one budget.

The bare-metal hosting providers also add up to more expensive than
you might think, again especially if you want either redundancy or
just backups.

It does support the model but if every single build executor is also
compiling Mesa from scratch locally, how long do you think that's
going to take?

OK, not sure who it is who's going to be approving every update to
every .gitlab-ci.yml in the repository, or maybe we just have zero
shared runners and anyone who wants to do builds can BYO.
