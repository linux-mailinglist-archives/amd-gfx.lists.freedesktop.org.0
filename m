Those are 4k by default on modern systems as well and while over allocating them to 64k is possible that not only wastes some VRAM but can also result in OOM situations because we can't allocate the necessary page tables to switch from 2MiB to 4k pages in some cases.

If possible, could you share the steps to change the hardware page size? 
I can try testing it on our system.
