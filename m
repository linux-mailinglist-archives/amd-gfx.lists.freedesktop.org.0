Hi everyone,

dma_fences have ever lived under the tyranny dictated by the module
lifetime of their issuer, leading to crashes should anybody still holding
a reference to a dma_fence when the module of the issuer was unloaded.

The basic problem is that when buffer are shared between drivers
dma_fence objects can leak into external drivers and stay there even
after they are signaled. The dma_resv object for example only lazy releases
dma_fences.

So what happens is that when the module who originally created the dma_fence
unloads the dma_fence_ops function table becomes unavailable as well and so
any attempt to release the fence crashes the system.

Previously various approaches have been discussed, including changing the
locking semantics of the dma_fence callbacks (by me) as well as using the
drm scheduler as intermediate layer (by Sima) to disconnect dma_fences
from their actual users, but none of them are actually solving all problems.

Tvrtko did some really nice prerequisite work by protecting the returned
strings of the dma_fence_ops by RCU. This way dma_fence creators where
able to just wait for an RCU grace period after fence signaling before
they could be save to free those data structures.

Now this patch set here goes a step further and protects the whole
dma_fence_ops structure by RCU, so that after the fence signals the
pointer to the dma_fence_ops is set to NULL when there is no wait nor
release callback given. All functionality which use the dma_fence_ops
reference are put inside an RCU critical section, except for the
deprecated issuer specific wait and of course the optional release
callback.

Additional to the RCU changes the lock protecting the dma_fence state
previously had to be allocated external. This set here now changes the
functionality to make that external lock optional and allows dma_fences
to use an inline lock and be self contained.

This patch set addressed all previous code review comments and is based
on drm-tip, includes my changes for amdgpu as well as Mathew's patches for XE.

Going to push the core DMA-buf changes to drm-misc-next as soon as I get
the appropriate rb. The driver specific changes can go upstream through
the driver channels as necessary.

Please review and comment,
Christian.
