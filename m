Okay, I've tried setting up PL_COHERENCY_CONTROL_3_OFF, where AxCACHE
can be forced from auto to predefined for reads and writes.
As I understand it, the cache bit should permit characteristic
mismatch to be accepted and prefetch to be enabled, when combined with
the read/write bits.
It doesn't seem to make a difference however.
I got the idea to look for this from the Armada8K and Tegra drivers.

It would be nice to know if dGPUs work at all on *any* DWC based PCIe
controllers.
We could use those as a starting point to find out what's broken here.

So either go back to the really old way of doing things, find and fix
the underlying problem, or wait for the IP to catch up?
