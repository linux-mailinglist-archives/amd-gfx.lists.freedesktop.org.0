Emmanuel told me about this during their work on 5.13 which I wasn't 
involved in, and now can't remember any of the details, so I guess I 
don't actually have any more information.
I'm working on getting a baseline setup for 5.15 (just udbg and the 
like), so if there is an issue I should soon find out about it and will 
get back to you.
