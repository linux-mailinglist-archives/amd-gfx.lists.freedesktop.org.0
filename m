The latter are still affected by clock changes, and even when the clock doesn't stop altogether, they still tick at 25 MHz, so the two kinds of GPU timestamps keep diverging further.

Yes. That one is problematic because user space uses the reference clock for converting the results of asynchronous GPU queries from clock ticks to seconds. Since that clock still ticks at 25 MHz, the computed values in seconds are incorrect and keep diverging further from the corresponding values from the AMDGPU_INFO ioctl.

Any thoughts on whether or not this might be feasible?
