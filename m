If the problem here in getting stuff moving for 3D LUT support in DRM is 
lack of a userspace that wants to use it, I would like to just make 
people aware that we are planning on shipping support for this in 
Gamescope/SteamOS.
(It is hooked up right now in the current Gamescope main branch).

We have pulled the patches for AMDGPU by Melissa into our tree and 
hooked it up (with a prefix VALVE1_ before the properties for now as 
stuff is not upstream in the kernel yet) and it seems to be working well 
right now.

I know that the work here not final, and we will definitely change it 
and update our kernel and userspace impl to accomodate that and are more 
than happy to provide testing for this work and other color work.

I understand there is a lot moving right now, with the new color API 
being proposed, etc; but I don't think this should necessarily require 
us blocking any 3D LUT, shaper LUT or other color work on the 
"legacy"(?) path while stuff there is being planned out.

I think it's really important that we keep moving with color support on 
the legacy path while the new one is being planned out to ensure we 
don't accidentally miss something later or end up with something 
suboptimal for a specific vendor.
