So basically, the non-virt flow is is: (video?) BIOS reserves memory, marks it
as reserved in e820, stores the physaddr somewhere, which the GPU driver gets.
Since I suppose this includes the framebuffer, this probably has to occur around
the moment the driver calls drm_aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers()
(which happens before this hw init step), right ?

... which brings me to a point that's been puzzling me for some time, which is
that as the hw init fails, the efifb driver is still using the framebuffer.

Am I right in suspecting that efifb should get stripped of its ownership of the
fb aperture first, and that if I don't get a black screen on hw_init failure
that issue should be the first focus point ?
