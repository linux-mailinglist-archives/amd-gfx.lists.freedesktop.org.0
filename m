I did look at the patch, but I haven't fully understood yet what you are 
trying to do here.

Well the main question is what are you trying to get from that 
information? The eviction list for example is completely meaningless to 
userspace, that stuff is only temporary and will be cleared on the next 
CS again.

What we could expose is the VRAM over-commit value, e.g. how much BOs 
which where supposed to be in VRAM are in GTT now. I think that's what 
you are looking for here, right?

Well I see the reasoning for that, but I also see why other drivers do a 
lot of the stuff we have as IOCTL as separate files in sysfs, fdinfo or 
debugfs.

Especially repeating all the static information which were already 
available under sysfs in the INFO IOCTL was a design mistake as far as I 
can see. Just compare what AMDGPU and the KFD code is doing to what for 
example i915 is doing.

Same for things like debug information about a process. The fdinfo stuff 
can be queried from external tools (gdb, gputop, umr etc...) as well 
which makes that interface more preferred.
