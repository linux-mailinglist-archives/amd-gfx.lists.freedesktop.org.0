I believe that in January, we had $2082 of network cost (almost
entirely egress; ingress is basically free) and $1750 of cloud-storage
cost (almost all of which was download). That's based on 16TB of
cloud-storage (CI artifacts, container images, file uploads, Git LFS)
egress and 17.9TB of other egress (the web service itself, repo
activity). Projecting that out gives us roughly $45k of network
activity alone, so it looks like this figure is based on a projected
increase of ~50%.

The actual compute capacity is closer to $1150/month.

The original answer is that GitLab themselves offered to sponsor
enough credit on Google Cloud to get us started. They used GCP
themselves so they could assist us (me) in getting bootstrapped, which
was invaluable. After that, Google's open-source program office
offered to sponsor us for $30k/year, which was I believe last April.
Since then the service usage has increased roughly by a factor of 10,
so our 12-month sponsorship is no longer enough to cover 12 months.

Unless the Google Cloud Platform starts offering DragonBoards, it
wouldn't reduce our bandwidth usage as the corporate network is
treated separately for egress.

Cheers,
Daniel
