Sorry totally missed this question.

Yes, exactly that. As discussed for the hotplug case we can do this.

Well I'm open to both approaches. I just think having drm_dev_enter/exit 
on each work item would be more defensive in case we forgot to 
cancel/sync one.

              well good question. My job is to watch over the

              adjust anybodies schedule.<br>
              <br>
              Is the patch to print a warning when the hardware is
              accessed without holding the locks merged yet? If not then
              that would probably be a good starting point.<br>

              Then we would need to unify this with the SRCU to make
              sure that we have both the reset lock as well as block the

            <p>In my understanding there is a significant difference
              between handling of GPU reset and unplug - while GPU reset
              use case requires any HW accessing code to block and wait
              for the reset to finish and then proceed, hot-unplug<br>
              is permanent and hence no need to wait and proceed but

          Essentially Daniels patch of having an
          amdgpu_device_hwaccess_begin()/_end() was the right approach.
          You just can't do it in the top level IOCTL handler, but
          rather need it somewhere between front end and backend.<br>

      <br>
      What I mean was the approach in patch #3 in this series where he
      replaced the down_read/up_read with
      amdgpu_read_lock()/amdgpu_read_unlock().<br>
      <br>
      I would just not call it amdgpu_read_lock()/amdgpu_read_unlock(),

            <p>Similar to handling device reset for unplug we obviously
              also need to stop and block any MMIO accesses once device
              is unplugged and, as Daniel Vetter mentioned - we have to
              do it before finishing pci_remove (early device fini)<br>
              and not later (when last device reference is dropped from
              user space) in order to prevent reuse of MMIO space we
              still access by other hot plugging devices. As in device
              reset case we need to cancel all delay works, stop drm
              schedule, complete all unfinished fences(both HW and
              scheduler fences). While you stated strong objection to
              force signalling scheduler fences from GPU reset, quote: <br>
            </p>
            <p>"you can't signal the dma_fence waiting. Waiting for a
              dma_fence also means you wait for the GPU reset to finish.
              When we would signal the dma_fence during the GPU reset
              then we would run into memory corruption because the
              hardware jobs running after the GPU reset would access
              memory which is already freed."<br>
              To my understating this is a key difference with
              hot-unplug, the device is gone, all those concerns are
              irrelevant and hence we can actually force signal
              scheduler fences (setting and error to them before) to
              force completion of any<br>
              waiting clients such as possibly IOCTLs or async page
              flips e.t.c.<br>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <br>
          Yes, absolutely correct. That's what I also mentioned to
          Daniel. When we are able to nuke the device and any memory
          access it might do we can also signal the fences.<br>

            <p>Beyond blocking all delayed works and scheduler threads
              we also need to guarantee no  IOCTL can access MMIO post
              device unplug OR in flight IOCTLs are done before we
              finish pci_remove (amdgpu_pci_remove for us).<br>
              For this I suggest we do something like what we worked on

              We also had same issue there, how to prevent MMIO accesses
              while the BARs are migrating. What was done there is a
              refcount was added to count all IOCTLs in flight, for any
              in flight  IOCTL the BAR migration handler would <br>
              block for the refcount to drop to 0 before it would
              proceed, for any later IOCTL it stops and wait if device
              is in migration state. We even don't need the wait part,
              nothing to wait for, we just return with -ENODEV for this
              case.</p>

        <p>If by top level you mean checking for device unplugged and
          bailing out at the entry to IOCTL or right at start of any
          work_item/timer function we have then seems to me it's better
          and more clear. Once we flushed all of them in flight there is
          no reason for them to execute any more when device is
          unplugged.<br>

    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Well I'm open to both approaches. I just think having
    drm_dev_enter/exit on each work item would be more defensive in case
    we forgot to cancel/sync one.<br>

                  My latest solution (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"

                  was not acceptable because of low level guards on the
                  register accessors level which was hurting
                  performance. Basically I need a way to prevent any
                  MMIO write accesses from kernel driver after device is
                  removed (UMD accesses are taken care of by page
                  faulting dummy page). We are using now hot-unplug code
                  for Freemont program and so up-streaming became more
                  of a priority then before. This MMIO access issue is
                  currently my main blocker from up-streaming. Is there
                  any way I can assist in pushing this on ?</p>

                      <p class="MsoNormal">I understood your concern. It

                        we can try to add all kernel  dma_fence waiting
                        in a list, and signal all in recovery threads.
                        Do you have same concern for compute cases? </p>

                  Yes, compute (KFD) is even harder to handle.<br>
                  <br>
                  See you can't signal the dma_fence waiting. Waiting
                  for a dma_fence also means you wait for the GPU reset
                  to finish.<br>
                  <br>
                  When we would signal the dma_fence during the GPU
                  reset then we would run into memory corruption because
                  the hardware jobs running after the GPU reset would
                  access memory which is already freed.<br>

                        The only reason it doesn't complain here is
                        because you use an atomic+wait_event instead of

                  Well, completely abandon those change here.<br>
                  <br>
                  What we need to do is to identify where hardware
                  access happens and then insert taking the read side of
                  the GPU reset lock so that we don't wait for a
                  dma_fence or allocate memory, but still protect the
                  hardware from concurrent access and reset.<br>

                            &gt; We have defined two variables
                            in_gpu_reset and reset_sem in adev object.
                            The atomic type variable in_gpu_reset is
                            used to avoid recovery thread reenter and
                            make lower functions return more earlier
                            when recovery start, but couldn't block
                            recovery thread when it access hardware. The
                            r/w semaphore reset_sem is used to solve
                            these synchronization issues between
                            recovery thread and other threads.<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; The original solution locked registers'
                            access in lower functions, which will
                            introduce following issues:<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; 1) many lower functions are used in
                            both recovery thread and others. Firstly we
                            must harvest these functions, it is easy to
                            miss someones. Secondly these functions need
                            select which lock (read lock or write lock)
                            will be used, according to the thread it is
                            running in. If the thread context isn't
                            considered, the added lock will easily
                            introduce deadlock. Besides that, in most
                            time, developer easily forget to add locks
                            for new functions.<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; 2) performance drop. More lower
                            functions are more frequently called.<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; 3) easily introduce false positive
                            lockdep complaint, because write lock has
                            big range in recovery thread, but low level
                            functions will hold read lock may be
                            protected by other locks in other threads.<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; Therefore the new solution will try to
                            add lock protection for ioctls of kfd. Its
                            goal is that there are no threads except for
                            recovery thread or its children (for xgmi)
                            to access hardware when doing GPU reset and
                            resume. So refine recovery thread as the
                            following:<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; Step 0:
                            atomic_cmpxchg(&amp;adev-&gt;in_gpu_reset,
                            0, 1)<br>
                            &gt;     1). if failed, it means system had
                            a recovery thread running, current thread
                            exit directly;<br>
                            &gt;     2). if success, enter recovery
                            thread;<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; Step 1: cancel all delay works, stop
                            drm schedule, complete all unreceived fences
                            and so on. It try to stop or pause other
                            threads.<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; Step 2: call
                            down_write(&amp;adev-&gt;reset_sem) to hold
                            write lock, which will block recovery thread
                            until other threads release read locks.<br>
                            <br>
                            Those two steps need to be exchanged or
                            otherwise it is possible that new delayed
                            work items etc are started before the lock
                            is taken.<br>
                            <br>
                            Just to make it clear until this is fixed
                            the whole patch set is a NAK.<br>

                            &gt; Step 3: normally, there is only
                            recovery threads running to access hardware,
                            it is safe to do gpu reset now.<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; Step 4: do post gpu reset, such as call
                            all ips' resume functions;<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; Step 5: atomic set
                            adev-&gt;in_gpu_reset as 0, wake up other
                            threads and release write lock. Recovery
                            thread exit normally.<br>
                            &gt;<br>
                            &gt; Other threads call the amdgpu_read_lock
                            to synchronize with recovery thread. If it
                            finds that in_gpu_reset is 1, it should
                            release read lock if it has holden one, and
                            then blocks itself to wait for recovery
                            finished event. If thread successfully hold
                            read lock and in_gpu_reset is 0, it
                            continues. It will exit normally or be
                            stopped by recovery thread in step 1.<br>
