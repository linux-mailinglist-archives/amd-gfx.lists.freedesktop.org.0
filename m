This whole thing reminds me of this:
https://xkcd.com/1172/
The problem is another module parameter is another interface to
maintain and validate.  Moreover, we've had a number of cases in the
past where users have under or overclocked and reported bugs or
stability issues and it did not come to light that they were doing
that until we'd already spent a good deal of time trying to debug the
issue.  This obviously can still happen if you allow any sort of over
or underclocking, but at least if you stick to the limits you are
staying within the bounding box of the design.
