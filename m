That assumes and AMD iGPU + AMD dGPU I believe ?  The system on
which the spurious ACPI_VIDEO_NOTIFY_PROBE events lead to spurious
KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE key-presses being reported uses an Intel iGPU
with an AMD dGPU. I don't have any hybrid gfx systems available for
testing atm, but I believe that in this case there will be 2 ACPI
video-busses, one for each GPU.

Note I'm not saying that that means that checking the originating
ACPI device is the companion of the GPUs PCI-device is the solution
here. But so far all I've heard from you is that that is not the
solution, without you offering any alternative ideas / possible
solutions to try for filtering out these spurious key-presses.

Regards,

Hans
