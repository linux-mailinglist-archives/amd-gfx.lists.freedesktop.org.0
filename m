[AMD Official Use Only - General]

Hi Lyude:

     Sorry for replying late.

     1. The payload increase/decrease routines are not for DP2.
     2. mst_bw_update is not used in amdgpu_dm, so those two functions are =
not getting used for now. I leave it there simply for future possible hook =
up.

Regards,
Jerry
