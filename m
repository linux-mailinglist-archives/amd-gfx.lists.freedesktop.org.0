The problem is that you need to allocate with GFP_ATOMIC, instead of
GFP_KERNEL, or things go very bad.

The scheduler dma-fence annotations I've had (well still have them here)
would catch this stuff, but thus far they got nowhere.

Yeah you have a simple enough shrinker for this not to be a problem. The
issue is that sooner or later things tend to not stay like that, and we're
trying to have common rules for dma_fence to make sure everyone follows
the same rules.
