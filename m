FWIW, we are shipping this right now in SteamOS Preview channel 
(probably going to Stable soon) and it seems to be working as expected 
and fixing issues there in instances we need to composite, compositor 
work we are forced to do would take longer than the compositor redzone 
to vblank.

Previously in high gfx workloads like Cyberpunk using 100% of the GPU, 
we would consistently miss the deadline as composition could take 
anywhere from 2-6ms fairly randomly.

Now it seems the time for the compositor's work to complete is pretty 
consistent and well in-time in gpuvis for every frame.

The only times we are not meeting deadline now is when there is an 
application using very little GPU and finishes incredibly quick, and the 
compositor is doing significantly more work (eg. FSR from 800p -> 4K or 
whatever), but that's a separate problem that can likely be solved by 
inlining some of the composition work with the client's dmabuf work if 
it has focus to avoid those clock bubbles.

I heard some musings about dmabuf deadline kernel work recently, but not 
sure if any of that is applicable to AMD.
