Hi John,

I am using a RX570, the guy from reddit changed from R600 to an 5700XT
and it seems it did solve his reboot problems.

As the system is rock solid with windows-10 and others seem to
experience similar behaviour I've decided to file a bug at the
kernel's bugzilla:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206903

Thanks for your suggestions & best regards, Clemens
