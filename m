My thinking with the original logic in radeon and the amdgpu non-DC
code was to only add the common modes to eDP/LVDS because the EDIDs
for those panels usually only had one mode in them and users almost
always wanted to do clone mode with an external monitor.  For external
monitors they often supported multiple modes already so there was less
incentive to add additional modes.  The default setting of the scaler
property was also different on eDP/LVDS (on) and external displays
(off).  If a user wanted to use the GPU scaler on an external display,
they could enable the scaler property and then manually add whatever
mode they wanted.  If they wanted to use the modes from the EDID, they
would just disable the scaler property and pick the mode from the
EDID.
