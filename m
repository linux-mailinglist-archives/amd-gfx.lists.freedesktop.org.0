Right, but so far I haven't noticed any positive effect. That and the intermittent freezes indicate the MCBP based preemption isn't actually working as intended yet.

Of course, the HW features should have priority. I mean as a fallback when the HW features effectively aren't available (which is currently always the case with amdgpu, even when the GPU has the HW features).

Even though mutter uses a high priority context via the EGL_IMG_context_priority extension, it's unable to reach a higher frame rate than a GPU-limited client[0]. The "Last preempted" line of /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/amdgpu_fence_info remains at 0x00000000.
