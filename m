Yes. Even worse, it's not obvious to people that something is broken,
where it is broken and why it is broken.

If this was just a KMS property then I wouldn't have anything to
complain about. The problem here is the sysfs / PPD thing.

The problem is that if the compositor didn't explicitly opt-in, then
it can break something (and it actually did). I appreciate the intent
(enabling it as broadly as possible) but the only way I can see how
you can enable feature at all is by somehow doing it per-compositor.

Given all of that, there shouldn't be a sysfs property (you should
revert this!) but it should be yet another KMS property.
