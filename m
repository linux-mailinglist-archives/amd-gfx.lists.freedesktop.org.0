In the meantime I have confirmed that all this is still more complicated:
even using the "suspend" method only works after boot, not after a system suspend
cycle. Yes, weird but reproducible.

I have tried to chase down the problematic release, and as suspected this
started to happen with 6.6.5; 6.6.4 is fine.

Based on this information I found the offending commits and reverted them
in order from 6.6.7, which fixes everything for me:

b0399e22ada0 "drm/amd/display: Remove power sequencing check"
45f98fccb1f6 "drm/amd/display: Refactor edp power control"

Suggestions on how to proceed would be appreciated. I can report this
to  -stable and request reverts, but wanted to check with the list first.

Thanks,
Holger
