Some chips have multiple encode/decode IP blocks that are actually
separate instances, however, we load balance between them so userspace
sees just one engine.  Also in some cases they are asymmetric (e.g.,
different sets of supported CODECs on each instance).  The driver
handles this by inspecting the command buffer and scheduling on the
appropriate instance based on the requested CODEC.  SDMA also supports
multiple IP blocks that are independent.
