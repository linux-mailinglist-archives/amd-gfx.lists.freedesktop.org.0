Which commit message? I was doing that early during i915 patch 
development but stopped in v2:

commit 968853033d8aa4dbb80fbafa6f5d9b6a0ea21272
Author: Tvrtko Ursulin <tursulin@ursulin.net>
Date:   Tue Nov 7 10:18:06 2023 +0000

     drm/i915: Implement fdinfo memory stats printing

     Use the newly added drm_print_memory_stats helper to show memory
     utilisation of our objects in drm/driver specific fdinfo output.

     To collect the stats we walk the per memory regions object lists
     and accumulate object size into the respective drm_memory_stats
     categories.

     v2:
      * Only account against the active region.

^^^ THIS ^^^

      * Use DMA_RESV_USAGE_BOOKKEEP when testing for active. (Tejas)

     v3:
      * Update commit text. (Aravind)
      * Update to use memory regions uabi names.

In code that would be here:

static void
obj_meminfo(struct drm_i915_gem_object *obj,
	    struct drm_memory_stats stats[INTEL_REGION_UNKNOWN])
{
	const enum intel_region_id id = obj->mm.region ?
					obj->mm.region->id : INTEL_REGION_SMEM;

So either active region or SMEM if no backing store. Maybe that should 
be improved too. Grr (to myself).

I don't see xe is counting total against all regions either, apart that 
maybe it has potential null ptr deref?

static void bo_meminfo(struct xe_bo *bo,
		       struct drm_memory_stats stats[TTM_NUM_MEM_TYPES])
{
	u64 sz = bo->size;
	u32 mem_type = bo->ttm.resource->mem_type;

Or is bo->ttm.resource always present in xe? Adding Matt according to 
git blame.

Tvrtko
