Hello Christian,

I solved this problem weeks ago. The problem was, the system I use could
only give 256 MB address range but GPU was demanding more. Even if I give 4
GB, PCIe slot is only having 256 MB, nothing more.  I put a empty area that
is between PCIe2 ( GPU was connected to this) and PCIe3 and everything
worked fine ( I moved forward the start adress of next PCIe device) . If
anyone encounters same problem, here is a sample Device Tree Source for
linux;

pci0: pcie@ffe240000 {
reg =3D <0xf 0xfe240000 0 0x10000>;
ranges =3D <0x02000000 0 0xe0000000 0x2 0x0 0x0 0x10000000
 0x01000000 0 0x0 0xf 0xf8000000 0x0 0x00010000>;
pcie@0 {
ranges =3D <0x02000000 0 0xe0000000
 0x02000000 0 0xe0000000
 0 0x10000000

 0x01000000 0 0x00000000
 0x01000000 0 0x00000000
 0 0x00010000>;
};
};

pci1: pcie@ffe250000 { // GPU CONNECTED TO THIS ONE
reg =3D <0xf 0xfe250000 0 0x10000>;
ranges =3D <0x02000000 0 0xe0000000 0x2 0x10000000 0x1 0x00000000
 0x01000000 0 0 0xf 0xf8010000 0 0x00010000>;
pcie@0 {
ranges =3D <0x02000000 0 0xe0000000
 0x02000000 0 0xe0000000
 0x1 0x00000000

 0x01000000 0 0x00000000
 0x01000000 0 0x00000000
 0 0x00010000>;
};
};

pci2: pcie@ffe260000 {
reg =3D <0xf 0xfe260000 0 0x10000>;
ranges =3D <0x02000000 0 0xe0000000 0x3 0x20000000 0 0x10000000 // 0x3
0x20000000 actually it must be 0x3 0x10000000 because I gave 4 GB to pci1
but I also added 256 MB empty area between them. So it started from 0x3
0x20000000
 0x01000000 0 0x00000000 0xf 0xf8020000 0 0x00010000>;
pcie@0 {
ranges =3D <0x02000000 0 0xe0000000
 0x02000000 0 0xe0000000
 0 0x10000000

 0x01000000 0 0x00000000
 0x01000000 0 0x00000000
 0 0x00010000>;
};
};

pci3: pcie@ffe270000 {
reg =3D <0xf 0xfe270000 0 0x10000>;
ranges =3D <0x02000000 0 0xe0000000 0x3 0x30000000 0 0x10000000
 0x01000000 0 0x00000000 0xf 0xf8030000 0 0x00010000>;
pcie@0 {
ranges =3D <0x02000000 0 0xe0000000
 0x02000000 0 0xe0000000
 0 0x10000000

 0x01000000 0 0x00000000
 0x01000000 0 0x00000000
 0 0x00010000>;
};

      Those ranges usually don&#39;t need to be a power of two (only the

      What could maybe work is VGA emulation, which essentially means

      They don&#39;t, resources are dynamically assigned instead.<br>
      <br>
      See on x86 you usually have 1GB 32-bit address space where the
      BIOS shuffles all the mandatory devices it sees at boot time into.
      <br>
      <br>
      Then when the motherboard has multiple PEG slots the BIOS also
      configures a 64-bit address space which is usually rather huge
      (256GB-1TB). Since the the VRAM and the doorbell BAR are 64bit
      BARs on the GPU they can be mapped into that as well.<br>
      <br>
      This way you can easily have 10 GPUs connected to your CPU.<br>
      <br></div></div></blockquote><div><div>Ah that was a clear answer. So=
 the adress that CPU uses after mapping is actully an imaginary/virtual adr=
ess. It depends on the operating systems bit configuration. If I am not wro=

th endpoint device.=C2=A0</div><div></div></div><div><br></div><div>=C2=A0<=

      The problem you have here is that U-config doesn&#39;t do this

                  Exactly as I thought. The hardware does support BAR
                  resize, but unfortunately 256MB is already the

              I can&#39;t decrease it to 256 MB again because driver does
              not accept :D. I am just wondering, does modern gaming

                            <div>Okay no problem. At least I know what
                              is the missing point now. The problem is
                              probably because of the .dtsi and u-boot
                              config files. Memory ranges are
                              overwriting like you said. I&#39;ll ask nxp t=
o
                              take some sample PCIe configuration for
                              GPUs.</div>

                                                        Possible, but
                                                        rather unlikely.
