Yeah, we are trying to do a `pure software suspend`, letting hypervisor =
to save/restore system images instead of guest OS.
And during the suspend process, we hope we can cancel the suspend =
request at any later stage.
We cancel suspend at late stages, it does behave like a pure software =
suspend.
