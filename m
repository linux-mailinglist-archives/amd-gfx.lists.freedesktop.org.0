Hi Someguy,

Your findings sound very familiar, my machine is also rock-solid
running Windows-10 - most of the MCEs happened for me with low-load
situations but firefox playing youtube in background.
First I didn't care that much - but now having experienced corrupted
firefox profiles and lost spreadsheet work it starts to get annoying.

I've filed a kernel bug regarding this issue:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206903
I would appreciate if you could report your findings there to give the
issue more data / weight.

Thanks, Clemens

About a month ago I switched back over to Linux after purchasing my 5700 XT as my initial plan was to go back to Linux. Since returning I've experienced multiple spontaneous MCE reboots. All happened while I was playing one particular game, Warcraft 3 Reforged. The MCE event is the following:

> Initially I figured it could be ram so I performed the usual test with no problems. Also tested with standard JEDEC as well and eventually received a MCE during Warcraft 3 reforged. After consulting with a few friends I decided to try a different power supply to no avail. I then bit the bullet and bought a brand new 3900x. I also cleared CMOS before getting my new 3900x and after. All cpu values are on auto with no PBO or manual overclocking. The only fancy is the ram. Yesterday, after owning the new 3900x for three days, I had a MCE while I was playing Warcraft 3 Reforged. I have tested other games but none of them caused a MCE or any crashes / freezes for that matter. World of Warcraft, The Outer Worlds, Stellaris, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

> One thing to note is I haven't received it during desktop usage. Only in Warcraft 3. I do have desktop compositing in both Xfce and KDE disabled and always have. Both of which used, tested, and received the MCE's during those sessions. I have noticed a pattern with the MCE crashes with Warcraft 3. They always happen during a GPU load drop off or increase transition. By that I mean when exiting a match to return to the lobby, or loading a map and when it switches from the loading screen to the match itself is when these MCE's happen. The entire screen quickly turns black, everything is hard locked, and then after about a minute or so the machine reboots on its own. It hasn't happened yet while in a middle of a match session, sitting in the lobby or at the main menu screen. Its consistently been during a transition. My theory is that this could possibly be a GPU hang from switching from one power state to another power state. With the GPU hanging, causes the CPU to stall, and thus a 
 MCE. The GPU hanging could explain the quick solid black screen as well as all output is stopped. But I'm really just assuming here form my own observations from my limited understanding. Possible reason why this triggers in Warcraft is because the other games have few moments of switching power states heavily. The Outer Worlds, World of Warcraft, Stellaris, and Counter-Strike Global Offensive all keep a constant high load on the GPU and the match sessions are long.

> From what its worth, I've had no major issues in Windows 10. The only quirks where initially a few TDR's that recovered from alt tabing out of most games with Google Chrome running. Disabling hardware acceleration in Chrome fixed those TDR's while alt-tabing out of games.

> From searching, the way I found this mailing list report, I've found quite a few reports of people talking about receiving MCE's that isn't the typical first generation MCE's reports from 2017 involving Ryzen.Where those where fixed by disabling c-states, ram, and changing power supply current from low to typical. These ones within the past year appear to all have a AMD GPU in common. I did notice a few with Intel CPU's as well paired up with a AMD GPU.
