Yeah, but that doesn't matter.

For the reference designs AMD basically just says how it should look 
like and then somebody else stitches it together. The handling of for 
example how connectors are detected is still the same.

AMD should somewhere have detailed documentation what's on that 
reference board, but to be honest I have absolutely no idea who to ask 
for that. It's simpler to just look into the tables used by all vendors.

Regards,
Christian.

The former will require changes to the amdgpu display code to register display i2c buses that are not used by the display connectors on the board so they can be used by 3rd party applications. Currently we only register i2c buses used for display connectors. The latter buses are already registered with the i2c subsystem since they are used for other things like EEPROMs on server and workstation cards and should be available via standard Linux i2c APIs. I'm not sure what i2c LED controllers each AIB vendor uses off hand. https://openrgb.org/index.html would probably be a good resource for that information.
