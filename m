FWIW, in another mail in this thread and
https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7462#issuecomment-1107681126
it was clarified that the problem was introduced between 5.17.3 and
5.17.4, where a few amdgpu changes were applied. Maybe they are the reason.

Anyway: Yes, as Gregkh said, a bisection really would help. But maybe
the amdgfx developers might already have an idea what might be wrong
here? The QubesOS ticket linked above has some more details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
