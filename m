 Linus pulls them into mainline.  At that point, mainline goes into RCs and=
 then mainline is bug fixes only.  Meanwhile in parallel, each subsystem is=
 working on new feature development for the next merge window (subsystem -n=
ext trees).  The trees tend to lag behind mainline a bit.  Most developers =
focus on them in support of upcoming features.  They are usually also where=
 bugs are fixed.  If a bug is fixed in the -next tree, what's the best way =
to get it into mainline?  I guess ideally it would be fixed in mainline and=
 them mainline would be merged into everyone's -next branch, but that's not=
 always practical.  Often times new features depend on bug fixes and then y=
ou'd end up stalling new development waiting for a back merge, or you'd hav=
e to rebase your -next branches regularly so that they would shed any patch=
es in mainline which is not great either.  We try and cherry-pick -x when w=
e can to show the relationship.

And it drives me crazy, I hate seeing drm patches show up in my stable
queue and I put them at the end of the list for this very reason.  I've
complained about it for years, but oh well...

Which "one" are you referring to here?
