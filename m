That sounds a bit suboptimal with compositors that want to maximize
plane usage, but I guess if your hw can't do anything (i.e. no upload
rectangle that's in crtc coordinates) then that's just what it is. And
for that case I guess there's not much more helpers that make sense to
share, since the hw is just so different than what I've heard about
thus far.

Ofc if all these limitations are just DC and not the hw, then that
would indicate DC has become a midlayer in this area and needs to
expose the actual hw interface and all that, but sounds like that's
not the case. Just fairly strange hw design.
