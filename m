I'd go further than that. If user space fails to retry the system call in response to -EINTR, that's a user-space bug, period. It can happen anytime for any number of other reasons. (That most system calls happen to get away without it most of the time doesn't make it not a bug)

(This is assuming the system call can be safely retried, otherwise returning -EINTR to user space for non-fatal signals would be a kernel bug)

I agree.
