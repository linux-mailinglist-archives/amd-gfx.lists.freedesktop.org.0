Yeah, and I completely agree with you. The whole situation around that 
is just horrible.

Well, I'm not hostile against developers, but just realistic that this 
will lead to even more problems.

And I rather avoid problems with end-users than with developers because 
the later are usually the more skilled people.

As far as I can see that Windows allowed to disable GPU recovery was 
actually the source of the problem and is absolutely no argument to 
repeat the same mistake on Linux again.

Yes and because of this I'm just rejecting this approach here.

Rebooting to disable GPU reset is perfectly fine and reasonable to do 
for a developer.

As I said the requirement I have for the other extreme is to make it a 
compile time only option and I'm trying to avoid that as well.

Christian.
