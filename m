This agrees with my understanding of the consensus here and what's
reasonable possible across different gpus. And in case this isn't clear:
This is very much me talking with my drm co-maintainer hat on, not with a
gpu vendor hat on (since that's implied somewhere further down the
discussion). My understanding from talking with a few other folks is that
the cpumask-style CU-weight thing is not something any other gpu can
reasonably support (and we have about 6+ of those in-tree), whereas some
work-preserving computation resource thing should be doable for anyone
with a scheduler. +/- more or less the same issues as io devices, there
might be quite bit latencies involved from going from one client to the
other because gpu pipelines are deed and pre-emption for gpus rather slow.
And ofc not all gpu "requests" use equal amounts of resources (different
engines and stuff just to begin with), same way not all io requests are
made equal. Plus since we do have a shared scheduler used by at least most
drivers, this shouldn't be too hard to get done somewhat consistently
across drivers

tldr; Acked by me.

Cheers, Daniel
