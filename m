To handle communication between user space and kernel space, AMD GPUs
use a ring buffer design to feed the engines (GFX, Compute, SDMA, UVD,
VCE, VCN, VPE, etc.).

The ring has a Read Pointer (rptr), which indicates where the engine
is currently reading packets from the ring, and a Write Pointer which
indicates how many packets software has added to the ring.  When the
rptr and wptr are equal, the ring is idle.  When software adds packets
to the ring, it updates the wptr, this causes the engine to start
fetching and processing packets.  As the engine processes packets, the
rptr gets updates until the rptr catches up to the wptr and they are
equal again.

Might want to cross link to the other process isolation documentation

enforce isolation only affects GFX and compute.  It's probably easier
to think about it as single process at a time mode for gfx/compute.
