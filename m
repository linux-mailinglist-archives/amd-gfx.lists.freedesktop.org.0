I think the addition about damage tracking should be a separate
paragraph, and not mixed in with the general explanation that no-op
updates might lead to oversync/overlocking issues. Because the damage
tracking issue is more a question of efficiency/power usage, but
should not (for most drivers/hw at least) result in delays and missed
updates due to oversynchronization of updates.

Also in my opinion the exact damage update rules are more a plane
property issue, and should probably be clarified there if the current
documentation is not clear enough. Since it's not about whether no-op
updates get avoided by the kernel, but what exact damage is implied in
various cases (and that implied damage has to exist, otherwise
backwards compatibility is broken, but userspace can avoid these
issues by setting an empty damage property for that plane update
explicitly).

So I think for this doc part here the discussed text is still good
enough, but we might need more in other places.
