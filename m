I still don't think it's good to let the kernel arbitrarily kill
processes that it thinks are not well-behaved based on some heuristics
and policy.

Can't this be outsourced to user space? Expose the information about
processes causing a device and let e.g. systemd deal with coming up
with a policy and with killing stuff.
