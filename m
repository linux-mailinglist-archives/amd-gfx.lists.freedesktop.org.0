I'm not sure what, if anything is wrong with the current generic PCIe
ASPM code in Linux.  I was speaking more from a hardware validation
standpoint.  E.g., our silicon validation and hardware teams run a lot
of tests on a bunch of platforms and tune the programming sequence for
speed/power/stability.  Then they hand the programming sequence off to
the software teams as sort of a golden config or rule set for ASPM
enablement in the OS for each device.  I'm not exactly sure how far
these sequences stray from what the core PCI code does.  Will try and
find out more.
