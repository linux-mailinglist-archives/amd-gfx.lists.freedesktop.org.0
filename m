Mhm, that's really interesting.

The BIF (bus interface) should be able to handle all power of twos 
between 8bits and 128bits on the hardware generation IIRC (but could 
also be 64bits or 256bits, need to check the hw docs as well).

So once the request ended up at the GPU it should be able to handle it. 
Maybe a mis-configured bridge in between?

As Robin noted as well we have two different issues here:

1. Cache coherency of system memory.
2. Unaligned accesses on IO memory.

The later can actually be avoided if we absolutely have to. E.g. for 
bringup with test the ASICs alone without any DRAM attached. That is so 
called ZFB (zero frame buffer) mode for the driver.

I don't think we ever made the necessary patches for that public, but in 
theory it is possible.

Only the first item is just not solvable cleanly as far as I understand it.

Regards,
Christian.
