Hi,
sorry for the delay.
Besides less time, I had to make myself familiar with bisecting and 
again kernel compiling. Last time I compiled the kernel myself was 
around 2010 I think.

Anyway it seems I found the bad commit. The result after bisecting 10 
commits is:

a53d959fe660341788cb8dbc3ac3330d90a09ecf is the first bad commit
commit a53d959fe660341788cb8dbc3ac3330d90a09ecf

     drm/amdgpu: immediately use GTT for new allocations

     commit a755906fb2b8370c43e91ba437ae1b3e228e8b02 upstream.

     Only use GTT as a fallback if we already have a backing store. This
     prevents evictions when an application constantly allocates and 
frees new
     memory.

     Partially fixes
