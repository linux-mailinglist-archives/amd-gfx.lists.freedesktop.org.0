                See what I want to avoid is a) to nail down the
                interface with the kernel on specific values and b) make
                it possible to easily expose new values.<br>
                <br>
                In other words what we could do with fdinfo is to have
                something like this:<br>
                <br>
GALLIUM_FDINFO_HUD=drm-memory-vram,amd-evicted-vram,amd-mclk glxgears<br>
                <br>
                And the HUD just displays the values the kernel provides
                without the need to re-compile mesa when we want to add
                some more values nor have the values as part of the
                UAPI.<br>

                      can set whether the value is absolute (e.g. memory

                                                Well the main question
                                                is what are you trying
                                                to get from that
                                                information? The

                                                example is completely
                                                meaningless to
                                                userspace, that stuff is

                                              correct and are stable

                                              You can suggest changes if
                                              you think some numbers are

                                                for that, but I also see
                                                why other drivers do a
                                                lot of the stuff we have
                                                as IOCTL as separate

                                      That's what I'm asking: Is this
                                      for some tool or to make some
                                      driver decision based on it?<br>
                                      <br>
                                      If you just want the numbers for
                                      over displaying then I think it
                                      would be better to put this into
                                      fdinfo together with the other
                                      existing stuff there.<br>

                                      If you want to make allocation
                                      decisions based on this then we
                                      should have that as IOCTL or even
                                      better as mmap() page between
                                      kernel and userspace. But in this
                                      case I would also calculation the
                                      numbers completely different as
                                      well.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      See we have at least the following
                                      things in the kernel:<br>
                                      1. The eviction list in the VM.<br>
                                          Those are the BOs which are
                                      currently evicted and tried to
                                      moved back in on the next CS.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      2. The VRAM over commit value.<br>
                                          In other words how much more
                                      VRAM than available has the
                                      application tried to allocate?<br>
                                      <br>
                                      3. The visible VRAM usage by this
                                      application.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      The end goal is that the eviction
                                      list will go away, e.g. we will
                                      always have stable allocations
                                      based on allocations of other
                                      applications and not constantly
                                      swap things in and out.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      When you now expose the eviction
                                      list to userspace we will be stuck
                                      with this interface forever.<br>

                                  <div>1. No list is exposed. Only sums
                                    of buffer sizes are exposed. Also,
                                    the eviction list has no meaning
                                    here. All lists are treated equally,
                                    and mem_type is compared with
                                    preferred_domains to determine where
                                    buffers are and where they should
                                    be.<br>

                                    interested in knowing the number of
                                    bytes of evicted VRAM right now. It
                                    can be as variable as the CPU load,
                                    but in practice it shouldn't be
                                    because PCIe doesn't have the
                                    bandwidth to move things quickly.<br>
