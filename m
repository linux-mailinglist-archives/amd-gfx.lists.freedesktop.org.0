So that thing should be called SMCA_GPU_UMC not SMCA_UMC_V2.

You don't need it - just export smca_get_bank_type() and test the bank
type at the call site.

That was just a suggestion anyway - it is not code I maintain so not my
call.

I don't know what's acceptable because I still am unclear as to what
that thing is supposed to do. It seems you are interested only in
uncorrectable errors.

How are those errors reported? #MC exception, deferred interrupt, simply
logged in the bank and we find them by polling?

Then, the commit message is talking about some "bad page retirement".
What does that do? What can the user do when she sees the

"Uncorrectable error detected in UMC..."

message?

It depends on what "retiring" of GPU pages means...

In any case, dmesg should issue a human-understandable message about the
recovery action being done and what that means for the user: should she
replace the GPU, should she ignore, etc, etc.

Actually, the notifier registration should be able to return a different
retval to state that a callback has already been registered but that
warns only currently so I'm guessing we're stuck with such ugly
"workarounds" for their shortcomings.

I'm gonna take a look whether they can be fixed though so that you don't
have to do this notifier_registered thing.
