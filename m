Adding more amdgpu folks.

Smells like this runtime pm leak is papering over an issue in the
amdgpu driver. Other bug reports are also only about amdgpu.ko it
seems, would an unconditional pm_runtime_get_sync() in
amdgpu_pci_probe() also work? If you do it before the
drm_aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers() which throws out
efifb it should be equivalent to the efifb revert.

That would avoid the revert for everyone else, but revert's fine too
imo this close to holidays. I don't think actually fixing this rpm fun
in a late -rc is realistic, these tend to be very gnarly.
