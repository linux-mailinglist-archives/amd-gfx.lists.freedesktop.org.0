Before you guys waste your time reading all the below, dont.
I had made a mistake in my patch to PCI basically causing the entire
tree of devices to get released, I was using an unsafe version of the
pci API.
It has been corrected following suggestions by the reviewer on the
original patch.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20260410052918.5556-2-gloveless@jqluv.com=
/

If you would like I still could submit some safety patch work as mario
was suggesting that its not a bad idea to have the ability
to handle edge case situations to prevent crashing in the future if
something goes awry. There was also one basically the GPU would not
get initialized correctly and it would attempt to access null
reference rings which never got filled.

I appreciate the help and explanation of how the systems on the GPU
work and look forward to learning more but hopefully not because of a
bug that either
I cause or run across haha :) I am going to start backing out the
kernel parameters in hopes that everything is happy with the pci fix I
implemented and hopefully i dont need to set params.
