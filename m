Please always mention the Linux kernel version.

So, did you do any changes to Linux? Why do you think the EDID is at fault?

[â€¦]

I suggest to analyze, why `No DP link bandwidth` is logged. The macro is 
`DC_NO_DP_LINK_BANDWIDTH`, and you should first check why 
`dp_validate_mode_timing()` in 
`drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/core/dc_link_dp.c` returns false.


Kind regards,

Paul
