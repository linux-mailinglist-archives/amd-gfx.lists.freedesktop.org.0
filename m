The DMA-ring-test of making the SDMA write into a WB location in the
system RAM succeeded.

The sequence followed mimics what the Linux driver does for the most part,
until evergreen_gpu_init. That and the portions of power mgmt, interrupt mg=
mt,
indirect buffer mgmt, the entire _modeset_init were skipped for now.

The WB and the CP, DMA ring buffers are PAGE_SIZE buffers in the system
RAM. GTT is a 512-entries table, in the BAR0 aperture, appropriately filled=
 in
to map the WB, CP and DMA buffers.

Understood. Yes, the DPM and the IH portions. I think by programming only
for the hardware I have I can manage to set them up with comparatively less
effort.
