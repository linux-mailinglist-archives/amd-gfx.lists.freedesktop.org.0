The most extreme examples so far are glxgears (runs at ~400 fps now, ~7000 fps before, i.e. almost 20x slowdown) and hexchat (scrolling one page now takes ~1 second, I can see it drawing line by line; before it was almost instantaneous). I suspect this series makes the overhead of running a single GPU job much bigger. On the bright side, I'm not noticing any significant intermittent freezes anymore.

That leaves ~10ms per display refresh cycle (at 60 Hz refresh rate) where GPU work from glxgears & Xwayland can run without getting preempted. Since glxgears runs at ~7000 fps without this series, it should be able to draw at least ~70 frames in 10ms[0], which corresponds to over 4000 fps. Yet it manages only 1/10 of that.

The issue is caused by the patch5 "drm/amdgpu: Improve the software rings priority scheduler" which slows down the low priority scheduler thread if high priority ib is under executing. I'll drop this patch as we cannot identify gpu bound according to the unsignaled fence, etc.

Okay, I'm testing with patches 1-4 only now.

So far I haven't noticed any negative effects, no slowdowns or intermittent freezes.

The only issue is that there's hardly any positive effect either. While constantly moving the window of a GPU-limited GpuTest benchmark in circles, most of the time it looks exactly the same as without these patches. Only occasionally, at most every few seconds, I notice that the window movement becomes smoother for an instant.
