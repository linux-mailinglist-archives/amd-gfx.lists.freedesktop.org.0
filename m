Quoting an earlier mail in that thread:

	Can you try which Debian kernel was the last one working fine
	respective the first being broken in this regard? You can find
	all kernels on https://snapshot.debian.org/. Please ask if it's
	unclear how to do that.

Yeah, you keep talking about Linux 3, 4, 5 and 6. These categories cover
several years of development each and thus are not helpful to locate the
change that broke your setup. Unless it is really 5.19 that was good and
6.0 that is bad which limits the amount of changes from:

	git rev-list v5.0..v6.0 | wc -l
	311041

to

	$ git rev-list v5.19..v6.0 | wc -l
	16584

=2E This is still a lot and we might ask you to do more tests to further
limit the set of candidate commits that are broken on your end.

You lost me here. What is "problem in view of hanging"? Are we talking
about more than one problem? Or different variants of the same problem?

ok.

There might be a misconception about the roles involved here.

In my eyes the situation is as follows: You have a problem. I (and
possibly others) offer to help. For now your problem report isn't in a
form that I can act upon. So it's in your interest to provide the
information that I ask for. If you don't want to do that, that's fine,
and I won't have sleepless nights about it. The likely outcome is that
the problem isn't addressed.

Parts of the misunderstanding here might also be a language barrier. So
maybe try to get some help in the kernel community that speaks your
native tongue.

Best regards
Uwe
