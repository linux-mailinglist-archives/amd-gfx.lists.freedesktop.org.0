At the start of the pipeline we immediately go into a 19bpc space. Except around 3DLUT, all color processing happens at this precision.
It's near the end of the color pipeline that we go from 19 to 12 in a block called DENORM. Other than some specialized ABM block, we then go into FMT that does 12 -> monitor bpc.

I didn't see any difference with my capture HW for 8bpc->8bpc either, so I left spatial dithering as default. There's enough extra precision that apparently it doesn't matter here.

Maybe your case always has an FP16 plane, say compositing space?
