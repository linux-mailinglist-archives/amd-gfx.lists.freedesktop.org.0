Explicit re-emit is the only way this can easily work correctly.  We
save the ring state and and job state in the job and then we replay
the state and re-emit a proper coherent packet stream after the reset.
When we re-emit, we update the offsets as appropriate so that the
logic works properly as you replay the job stream.  You can skip the
IBs for the timedout context, but as long as the rest of the logic is
there, everything works.  Saving and restoring the opaque ring
contents is much harder because you need to either save a bunch of
pointers or try and determine which offsets to patch, etc.
