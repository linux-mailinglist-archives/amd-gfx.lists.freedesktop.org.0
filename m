Seems to crash both ways.  I'd rather either:
1. Remove the * when the clock is outside of the min and max ranges
or
2. Clamp the clock to the max or min if it's above or below.

And then fix the tools accordingly.  Those seem like the choices of
least surprise considering the interface is supposed to show the
current and available DPM levels.
