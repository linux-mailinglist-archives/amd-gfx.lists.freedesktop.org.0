Hi Rodrigo!

Thanks a lot for your reply! Comments below, please bear with me: I'm
a bit familiar with the cursor issues, but my knowledge of AMD hw is
still severely lacking.

Right. This revert actually makes things worse. Prior to the revert the
overlay could be enabled without the cursor. With the revert the overlay
cannot be enabled at all, even if the cursor is disabled.

I'm working on gamescope [1], Valve's gaming compositor. Our use-cases incl=
ude
displaying (from bottom to top) a game in the background, a notification po=
pup
over it in the overlay plane, and a cursor in the cursor plane. All of the
planes might be rotated. The game's buffer might be scaled and might not co=
ver
the whole CRTC.

libliftoff [2] is used to provide vendor-agnostic KMS plane offload. In oth=
er
words, I'd prefer to avoid relying too much on hardware specific details, e=
.g.
I'd prefer to avoid hole-punching via a underlay (it might work on AMD hw, =
but
will fail on many other drivers).

I'm usually using the latest kernel (at the time of writing, v5.13.10), but=
 I
often test with drm-tip or agd5f's amd-staging-drm-next, especially when
working on amdgpu patches.

My primary hardware of interest is RDNA 2 based (the upcoming Steam Deck), =
but
of course it's better if gamescope can run on a wide range of hardware.

I don't know if there's an IGT covering my use-case.

What are DCHUBBUB and MMHUBBUB responsible for? Is one handling the primary
plane and the other handling the overlay plane? Or something else entirely?

Hm, but I don't want to draw multiple cursors. I want to draw a single
cursor. If all planes are enabled, can't we paint the cursor only on the
overlay plane and not paint the cursor on the primary plane?

Or maybe it's impossible to draw the cursor on the overlay plane outside
of the overlay plane bounds?

I'm also confused by the commit message in "drm/amd/display: Fix two cursor
duplication when using overlay", because an overlay which doesn't cover the
whole CRTC used to work perfectly fine, even with the cursor plane enabled.

Yeah, as I said above this requires knowing a lot about the target hardware=
,
which is a bit unfortunate. This requires hole-punching and significantly
changes the composition logic.
