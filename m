Initial patches for S0ix platform support:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/platform-driver-x86/patch/20201023080410.458629-1-Shyam-sundar.S-k@amd.com/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-acpi/patch/20201023080315.458570-1-Shyam-sundar.S-k@amd.com/

You also need the following GPU driver patches:
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/82762/

There is also an audio patch required which will be available soon.
