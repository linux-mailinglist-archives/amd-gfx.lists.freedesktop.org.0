In that case I think we should not re-emit the work at all.

For example even if VRAM is not lost after a GPU reset the remaining state (VM etc..) is gone and can't be restored easily as far as I see.

We should absolutely not re-emit prending jobs in that case. It's basically just jepardy if that works or not.

Every engine can do that, we just have to insert NOPs until you end up at the specific location.

That is harmless, just overwrite with NOPs. That's certainly something all rings can do.

It's not only the job object itself, but also all objects it eventually points to.

For example job->vm is invalid after you initially emitted the job and exactly that has been caused issues tons of times.

And exactly that is what I'm trying to prevent. Emitting jobs multiple times was an extremely bad idea.

I can't count how many hours we have spend over the last 10 years just to try to get that working and we still have the same problems we had at the beginning.

So I absolutely see no change that this will change.
