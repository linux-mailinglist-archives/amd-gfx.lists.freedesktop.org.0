Hi Krunoslav,

(dropped Rodrigo from the mail thread, as he seems no longer with AMD's
display team, and stable kernel for the moment).

Ok, that makes a lot more sense. I can understand that. My own software and
users have the same critical requirement for some use cases, of being able
to pass through ARGB8888 surfaces to 8 bpc video sinks. They connect
special neuroscience display equipment that parses special binary control
information out of false-color coded framebuffer images, or implements very
high color precision display up to 16 bpc per color channel on top of 8 bpc
framebuffers and some shader magic. Luckily, using a standard 8 bpc
framebuffer under the native X-Server, a 8 bpc DVI-D or DP video sink, and
loading a specifically crafted gamma table achieved this for our case,
despite the spatial dithering-down-to-8bpc being active. DC has some
special detection function (__is_lut_linear() in amdgpu_dm_color.c) that
detects if a user provided gamma lut is essentially meant to be a linear
identity mapping lut, and if so, enables lut bypass or identity mapping
iirc, and that does the trick well enough for us atm. At least under
OpenGL + Xorg on modern DCN display engines. For older DCE engines, my
software does its own low-level MMIO register programming to get rid of
unwanted dithering, or to enforce the dithering it needs, but this has
become impractical/infeasible for DCN.

I haven't tested this yet under Wayland, as the Wayland eco system is not
ready for the more demanding use cases, and we still have to cling to the
native X-Server for possibly quite a while longer.

Do you know what use cases those customers have for 10 bpc identity
passthrough? I wonder if they are very similar to my use cases for 8 bpc
identity passthrough.

The rounding mode poses a problem for some of my users though, the research
labs that can't afford or use highly specialized display equipment for the
price of an upper class car, and possibly not even the price of
"conventional" high end display monitors ("reference monitors", "broadcast
monitors" as used in movie and tv/streaming post-production etc.) with true
12 bpc input and processing. Or situations where video bandwidth limits
enforce an only 10 bpc output even for 12 bpc capable sinks. Those can be
fine with 10 bpc + gpu dithering.

Looking at all callers of resource_build_bit_depth_reduction_params(), they
all have access to the associated "struct pipe_ctx", which should give
access to pipe_ctx ->plane_state->format of an associated display plane. I
could prepare a patch that passes the pipe_ctx from each caller
into resource_build_bit_depth_reduction_params() and that function could
check if a 16 bpc framebuffer is in use and switch to spatial dithering
down-to-10-bpc in this case, and leave the rounding/truncation to 10 bpc
otherwise.

This workaround, that you also propose, would be the least bad of all bad
solutions.

One goal of the current patch was to be easy to backport, and also to still
make it into drm-fixes before Linux 7. Linux 7.0 will be the standard
distribution kernel for the upcoming Ubuntu 26.04-LTS, and therefore
important for my users.

I think what would really be needed in the long term is a drm connector
property to control dithering. Some kms drivers had this in the olden days,
many years ago. I don't think a guess-o-matic will always guess right,
given that having > 10 bpc precision via dithering will be also beneficial
on 8 or 10 bpc framebuffers + gamma tables for most use cases.

Thanks,
mario

There is a reason for the change that is alluded in the commit, but perhaps=
 I should&#39;ve been clearer.<br>
If you have an ARGB2101010 surface and monitor is 10bpc, one of the HW desi=
gn goals is that we can output this in a bit-perfect way, i.e., for every s=
urface pixel value K=3D0..1023, monitor will receive K at its end. It&#39;s=
 also one of the things some customers have checked for and complained abou=
t historically. This is very hard to see visually or even with a colorimete=
r but is readily apparent with a HW capture card.<br>
<br>
Our HW can accomplish this 10-bit perfect requirement if set up correctly, =
however, it can only do so if we use rounding, not dithering.<br>
For example, say you have a 10-bit code 200, our pipeline precision and err=
or accumulation may result with 200.15, which in 12bpc before dithering wou=
ld be 801 and the nature of the spatial dithering is that now and then RNG =
result will push that to 201 output, it&#39;s just the way it works. Roundi=
ng is several times less sensitive to this, and without this randomness com=
ponent, we can verify we&#39;re always accurate enough at 10bpc level.<br><=
/blockquote><div><br></div><div>Ok, that makes a lot more sense. I can unde=
rstand that. My own software and users have the same critical requirement f=

linear identity mapping lut, and if so, enables lut bypass or identity mapp=

enGL=C2=A0+ Xorg on modern DCN display engines. For older DCE engines, my s=

I believe we don&#39;t have surface info in that code, but one way to work =
around it would be to use spatial dithering for FP16/ARGB16 and rounding fo=

Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Change dither policy for 10 bpc output ba=

Commit d5df648ec830 (&quot;drm/amd/display: Change dither policy for 10bpc =
to<br>
round&quot;) degraded display of 12 bpc color precision output to 10 bpc si=
nks by switching 10 bpc output from dithering to &quot;truncate to 10 bpc&q=
uot;.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t find the argumentation in that commit convincing, but the conse=
quences highly unfortunate, especially for applications that require effect=
ive &gt; 10 bpc precision output of &gt; 10 bpc framebuffers.<br>
<br>
The argument wasn&#39;t something strong like &quot;there are hardware desi=
gn defects or limitations which require us to work around broken dithering =
to 10 bpc&quot;, or &quot;there are some special use cases which do require=
 truncation to 10 bpc&quot;, but essentially &quot;at some point in the pas=
t we used truncation in Polaris/Vega times and it looks like it got inadver=
tently changed for Navi, so let&#39;s do that again&quot;. I couldn&#39;t f=
ind evidence for that in the git commit logs for this. The commit message a=
lso acknowledges that using dithering &quot;...makes some sense for FP16...=
<br>
...but not for ARGB2101010 surfaces...&quot;<br>
<br>
The problem with this is that it makes fp16 surfaces, and especially<br>
rgba16 fixed point surfaces, less useful. These are now well supported by M=
esa 25.3 and later via OpenGL + EGL, Vulkan/WSI, and by OSS AMDVLK Vulkan/W=
SI/display, and also by GNOME 50 mutter under Wayland, and they used to pro=
vide more than 10 bpc effective precision at the output.<br>
<br>
Even for 8 or 10 bpc surfaces, the color pipeline behind the framebuffer, e=
.g., gamma tables, CTM, can be used for color correction and will benefit f=
rom an effective &gt; 10 bpc output precision via dithering, retaining some=
 precision that would get lost on the way through the pipeline, e.g., due t=
o non-linear gamma functions.<br>
<br>
Scientific apps rely on this for &gt; 10 bpc display precision. Truncating =
to 10 bpc, instead of dithering the pipeline internal 12 bpc precision down=
 to 10 bpc, causes a serious loss of precision. This also creates the undes=
irable and slightly absurd situation that using a cheap monitor with only 8=
 bpc input and display panel will yield roughly 12 bpc precision via dither=
ing from 12 -&gt; 8 bpc, whereas investment into a more expensive monitor w=
ith 10 bpc input and native 10 bpc display will only yield 10 bpc, even if =
a fp16 or rgb16 framebuffer and/or a properly set up color pipeline (gamma =
tables, CTM&#39;s etc. with more than 10 bpc out<br>
precision) would allow effective 12 bpc precision output.<br>
<br>
Therefore this patch proposes reverting that commit and going back to dithe=
ring down to 10 bpc, consistent with the behaviour for 6 bpc or 8 bpc outpu=
t.<br>
<br>
Successfully tested on AMD Polaris DCE 11.2 and Raven Ridge DCN 1.0 with a =
native 10 bpc capable monitor, outputting a RGBA16 unorm framebuffer and me=
asuring resulting color precision with a photometer. No apparent visual art=
ifacts or problems were observed, and effective precision was measured to b=
e 12 bpc again, as expected.<br>
