The flag was dropped because it was causing drivers that requested their
memory resource with pci_request_region() to fail with -EBUSY (e.g: the
vmwgfx driver):

It's supposed to be released once amdgpu asks for conflicting framebuffers
to be removed calling drm_aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers().

I'm not familiar with the amdgpu driver, but maybe that call has to be done
earlier before the arch_io_reserve_memtype_wc() ?

That registered resource is what the firmware provides for drivers to use
the system framebuffer for scan-out. It's not the real thing, that's true
since a native driver would kick it out (leading to a resource release)
and register the real aperture.
