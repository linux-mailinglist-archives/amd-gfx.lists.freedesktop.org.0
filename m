[+cc Greg, no action needed yet, just FYI that stable will want these]

I would say something like:

  This prevents writes to unimplemented space, which would cause
  Unsupported Request errors.  Prior to 8795e182b02d ("PCI/portdrv:
  Don't disable AER reporting in get_port_device_capability()"), these
  errors occurred but were ignored.

The write is the error; AER is just the reporting mechanism.

We need a cc: stable because 8795e182b02d ("PCI/portdrv: Don't disable
AER reporting in get_port_device_capability()") has already been
backported to at lealst these stable kernels:

  5.10.137 5.15.61 5.18.18 5.19.2

and these fixes need to go there as well.  So add something like this:

  Fixes: 8795e182b02d ("PCI/portdrv: Don't disable AER reporting in get_port_device_capability()")
  cc: stable@vger.kernel.org

It's not that there was something wrong with 8795e182b02d and these
patches fix it; it's just that 8795e182b02d *exposed* an amdgpu
problem that was there all along.  But we need some way to connect
with it.
