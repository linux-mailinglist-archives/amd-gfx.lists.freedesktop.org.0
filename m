Hi Amir,

I pushed a work in progress branch here:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Venemo/linux/-/commits/ven_retry_faults_navi4

This contains the two series that I sent to the mailing list yesterday:
"Improve retry fault handling"
"Improve soft IH ring"

If we have to rely on the soft IH ring on Navi4, then we absolutely need th=
e=20
patches from "Improve soft IH ring", as it fixes a few bugs and switches th=
e=20
soft IH ring to use the system unbound workqueue. Otherwise it can happen t=
hat=20
the soft IH ring fills up even before your CPU can process anything in it.=
=20
(This is especially bad on HW that doesn't have the filter CAM enabled,
eg. Strix Halo.)

On top of that,

There is a patch to solve the race condition and make sure that the retry C=
AM=20
is ACKed after the VM update is complete. On Navi 31, this works and=20
successfully makes sure that the race is eliminated and each VM fault is on=
ly=20
processed once. I'd like to submit these if you guys agree on the approach.

And finally, there is a very messy patch that contains what I tried to do t=
o=20
get it all working on Navi 48. This has a lot of comments with my notes dur=
ing=20
development, and some attempts I tried to fix the issue (without success).

Basically, what I did was:

=2D Enable the retry CAM the same way as I did on IH 6.0 exactly like you s=
aid
=2D Added the cam_index to gmc_v12_0_process_interrupt
=2D Added a few bits to gfxhub_v12_0 and gfx_v12_0 to actually enable retry=
=20
faults (without that, the faults don't have the retry bit in src_data[1])

Now, what I observe on Navi 48 is:

1. Retry fault interrupt is triggered
2. Dispatched on the soft IH ring
3. The interrupt handler is called again on the soft IRQ ring
4. The fault is mitigated by amdgpu_vm_handle_fault()
5. Finally, the retry CAM is ACKed
6. As soon as the CAM is ACKed, I get another interrupt for the same addres=
s,=20
and it goes on infinitely or until GPU reset is triggered.

Attempts at fixing what I saw on Navi 48:

=2D Tried to add a TLB flush to various places. Now that the race is mitiga=
ted,=20
the TLB flush doesn't make things worse anymore, but it's also not helping.
=2D Tried to set the FORCE_MISS bits on various cache related registers, ho=
ping=20
that it would work around the possibility of the PTE/PDE not being updated =
in=20
the cache. This didn't help either.
=2D Tried to use amdgpu.vm_update_mode=3D3 to use the CPU to update the pag=
e=20
tables, but that didn't help on Navi 48
=2D Tried to halt the CP using CP_ME_CNTL to see if it would stop sending=20
interrupts, but it didn't.
=2D Using umr I tried to disable the L2 cache and reset it with the GRBM, b=
ut=20
that just broke the whole system.

Other notes on the retry fault topic in general:

=2D On GPUs that don't have the retry CAM (eg. Navi 1-2 and APUs) we'll nee=
d to=20
consider disabling the VM fault interrupt while processing the retry, becau=
se=20
the soft IH ring can fill up really quickly and the CPU may struggle to kee=
p up=20
with it.
=2D In general (for all GPUs), I think it would be better to update a large=
r VA=20
range of subsequent pages rather than just a single page, in order to more=
=20
efficiently mitigate VM faults to neighbouring pages.
=2D Currently all of the invalid accesses are redirected to the same dummy =
page,=20
which is a security hole because it means that a process that had an out of=
=20
bounds write can leak data to a process that does an out of bounds read. I=
=20
already talked to Christian about this, he has a few ideas how to fix it.

Thanks & best regards,
Timur
