What happens is this simple: after a few minutes, about 6 or so, the entire
content of the screen stays still. In some minor situations only the
applications panel of KDE Plasma.

If music is playing it continues playing, so only graphics are hung. Yet in
most cases the power button won't shut down the computer, as it usually
does.

At least this is the case using kwin on x11, and not on wayland. It only
happens on "radeon" and not on Intel or "radeonhd".

    Correct, but a TV is intended for videos only. That&#39;s why it
    implements only the lower HDMI standard.<br>
    <br>
    Interlaced transmits only halve the lines with each frame, so a 60Hz
    mode effectively either becomes a 30Hz mode, halving the vertical
    resolution or adaptive motion compensated which the know visual
    artifacts. Depending on what the deinterlacing setting on your TV
    is.<br>
    <br>
    You could just add a progressive 1920x540@60 or 1920x1080@30 mode
    manually and would have the same effect with probably better
    quality. See <a href=3D"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinterlacing" ta=
rget=3D"_blank">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinterlacing</a> for
    reference.<br>
    <br>
    If you can give us some more information what is happening when the
    system freeze we could try to narrow this down, but we can&#39;t spend
    much time on a very specific use case in a driver which is in
    maintenance mode.<br>

                          <div> Mhm, no idea why an interlaced
                            resolution would cause a crash. Maybe some
                            miscalculation in the display code.<br>
                            <br>
                            But apart from that if you just connected
                            your PC to a TV I also wouldn&#39;t recommend
                            using an interlaced resolution in the first
                            place.<br>
                            <br>
                            See those resolutions only exists for
                            backward compatibility with analog hardware.<br=

                            I think we would just disable those modes
                            instead of searching for the bug.<br>
