After some digging, if I understand correctly, the PSP is the 3rd IP
getting its hw_init() called.  First comes soc15_common, then vega10_ih.

- soc15_common_init_hw does some writes through nbio_v7.0 functions,
  but does not query the hw to check before or after
- vega10_init_hw does some register reads as part of its work, but once
  it has written it does not check either

So PSP is the first one to check that "soc15" (I'm still not sure what
this one represents, really) is in fact alive and well.

Can't we check earlier that the chip is really listening to us ?
