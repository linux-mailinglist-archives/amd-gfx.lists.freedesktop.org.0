No, it clearly gets that signaled. We should probably replace the guilty 
atomic with a calls to drm_sched_entity_error().

It's just that this isn't what Marek and I had in mind for this, 
basically completely forget about AMDGPU_CTX_OP_QUERY_STATE or 
AMDGPU_CTX_OP_QUERY_STATE2.

Instead just look at the return value of the CS or query fence result IOCTL.

When you get an -ENODATA you have been guilty of causing a soft 
recovery, when you get an -ETIME you are guilty of causing a timeout 
which had to be hard recovered. When you get an -ECANCELED you are an 
innocent victim of a hard recovery somebody else caused.

What we haven't defined yet is an error code for loosing VRAM, but that 
should be trivial to do.

Regards,
Christian.
