Both my systems were running rc6 - I was stuck in a state
where I was able to rebase to rc7 and then 6.18, but could
never build either one.

When I suspected rc6 to be the problem, I booted rc5 and compiled 6.18
after reverting 39231e8d6ba based on config file changes between rc5
and rc6.

I retested on both systems on 6.18 making sure I have 5bebe8de19264
and 39231e8d6ba in there. I cloned linux_next and built it on both.

I didn't see any problems on 6.18. Having said that, It might make
sense to hold off on including 39231e8d6ba in 6.18 so there is more
time to test beyond 2 rc cycles. That is for you all to decide.
