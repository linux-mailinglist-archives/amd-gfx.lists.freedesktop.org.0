      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">
Is that the last working or the first broken?

The last kernel in Debian 11 (i.e. buster) is 5.10.218-1. Or do you mean
the last in buster-security which would be 5.10.244-1? Or do you mean
the one that Debian 11.0 was released with, that would be 5.10.46-4 (I
think)?

The kernels before and after that are depending on what you meant above
5.10.216-1 or 5.10.237-1 or 5.10.46-3 and 5.10.221-1 or
5.13.9-1~exp1 or 5.10.46-5. Which one do you mean?

The gist to take away here is: Don't specify kernel versions as "the one
in Debian 11" or "kernel 5" but use the proper kernel (package) version.

So, English isn't native one for you? :)

      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">Right, and I doubt it's yours either. Or you would be the first native
English speaker in my career that I fail to understand when
communicating about Linux topics. (The only other explanations for that
I can come up with are a) you suffer from dyslexia; or b) you write
glibberish on purpose to annoy.)

statement like:

	broken with the following symptoms: [....]. The kernel image
	that occurs in the list on
	<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://snapshot.debian.org/package/linux/">https://snapshot.debian.org/package/linux/</a> directly after that
	(i.e. version e.f.g-h) doesn't show these symptoms.</pre>
