That's a really good argument, but the issue is that it is fixable. It's 
just that nobody had time to look into all the issues.

If started efforts to fix this years ago, but there was always something 
more important going on.

So we are left with the choice of breaking old applications or new 
applications or getting somebody working on fixing this.
