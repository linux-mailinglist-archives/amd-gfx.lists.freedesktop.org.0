ATPX is the name of an ACPI method.  It stands for ATI PowerXpress.
PowerXpress was the marketing name associated with dGPU d3cold when it
was a vendor specific feature.  Eventually this was standardized by
ACPI and there are standard methods for controlling device power in
the ACPI layer.

The ATPX method still exists on some laptops with a dGPU, but it no
longer controls the dGPU power.  That is handled via standard ACPI
methods now and has been for a while.  The driver checks the ATPX
method to determine whether it should use ATPX or the standard ACPI
interfaces for power control.

> * MACO and BAMACO looks similarly related (I may have missed some ;)

BOCO/BACO/BAMACO are all names for various low power states GPU can be put =
into.

B =3D Bus
M =3D Memory
C =3D Chip
A =3D Active
O =3D Off

So BOCO would be Bus Off Chip Off.  Basically the entire PCIe device
is powered down.  Since the PCIe device is powered down, it no longer
appears on the PCIe bus.  This is handled by either ATPX or the
standard ACPI d3cold methods.  BACO is Bus Active Chip Off.  In BACO,
the bus interface is still up, but the chip is powered down, so the
device still shows up on the PCIe bus, but most of the chip is powered
down.  BAMACO and BOMACO are similar to BACO and BOCO, but they keep
VRAM powered up so VRAM contents are not lost when the device is
powered down.

CRAT was an ACPI table which was used for topology information for
APUs for ROCm.  Unfortunately, not all board vendors properly
supported the table, so the driver has a fallback to handle missing
CRAT tables.  It hasn't been used for a long time.

IIRC, the switcheroo code looks for certain ACPI methods on its own as well=
.

ATPX was also used for mux switching on laptops which had a display
mux between the APU and the dGPU.  The switcheroo stuff was for
handling that.
The message comes from the audio driver.  I think it just checks for
the presence of ATPX and sets up switcheroo on the audio side. Someone
could improve the logic in the audio driver (and the switcheroo code
as well) to follow what the GPU driver does if you wanted to avoid
those messages.
