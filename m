If this is truly mfence-not-working-as-expected, wondering how any user
app which relies on a similar mechanism can reliably work on their systems.

Had already mentioned this before -

Even by the assumption that mfence fixed ordering but data stayed in WC
buffer, there is one other hole in this theory. With DOORBELL_MODE=1,
any write pointer update is fetched from memory. That write pointer is
also maintained in WC type memory. If CP is correctly able to see WPTR
update, that means that part of write got updated in system memory.

Anyway, please keep us posted.
