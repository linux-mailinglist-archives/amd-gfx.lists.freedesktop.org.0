There is absolutely nothing bad or wrong with that, as a matter of fact, 
some driver designs prefer to keep it like this, and let the core API 
minimal and focused on core functionality. This is just about choice.

Understand that there was no reference counting for pm profile change so 
far, as it was probably written considering sysfs interface and never 
considered a multi-client environment.

Like workload context, If there are other current/future clients who 
could also use these APIs, it would be a very important reason to add 
this workload reference counting in central pm structure (rather than 
multiple scattered places), so that every new API/consumer can 
understand and use this, and consider a system-wide scenario of DPM 
power profile, instead of a narrow view of its own thread. The central 
counter will indicate that more than one consumers/clients can change 
the power profile, not only this thread.
