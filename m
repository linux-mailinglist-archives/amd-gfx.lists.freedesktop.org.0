Ok, so at least for pci devices you could do something like

if (pci_dev_is_disconnected())
    drm_dev_unplug();
else
    drm_dev_unregister();

In the ->remove callback and both users and developers should be
happy. I guess for other drivers like usb/spi just yanking the cable
for driver hacking is good enough - loss of power should also reset
the device :-)
