And you? :)

I very well know the bisecting approach, but I have no time, due to I 
have many other unresolved problems to spend this time on them.

Once I fix that, I won't need your participation in whether pushing the 
patch to the upstream or even starting myself builds, especially after 
definition my as a liar by closing the bug with such reasons.

Imagine for your, as an ordinal user will report this bug, when the 
installed system cannot even boot and he beginning Linux from Debian 
9,10,12,13!!! :)

And then imagine, as the ordinal user, who just tried Debian, will go to 
compile many kernels in the bisecting approach for detection the two 
controversy represents in different kernels. :)

And then imaging, as he'll prove the stack of the broken changes in 
mainstream! :)

And I have clashed with that MANY times for not throw myself immediately 
in the mess, when I can just apply the workaround and what I have 
expected from you!

And farewell, since I have no reason of further saying with you after 
the bug closing, since in Debian there "is no problem". :)
