Cache coherency is defined as mandatory there. Non-cache coherency is an 
optional feature.

See section 2.2.6.5 in the PCIe 2.0 specification for a good example.

            <br>
            <br>
            I apologize for raising this email chain from the dead, but
            there have
            <br>
            been some developments that have introduced even more
            questions.
            <br>
            I've looped the Rockchip mailing list into this too, as this
            affects
            <br>
            rk356x, and likely the upcoming rk3588 if [1] is to be
            believed.
            <br>
            <br>
            TLDR for those not familiar: It seems the rk356x series (and
            possibly
            <br>
            the rk3588) were built without any outer coherent cache.
            <br>
            This means (unless Rockchip wants to clarify here) devices
            such as the
            <br>
            ITS and PCIe cannot utilize cache snooping.
            <br>
            This is based on the results of the email chain [2].
            <br>
            <br>
            The new circumstances are as follows:
            <br>
            The RPi CM4 Adventure Team as I've taken to calling them has
            been
            <br>
            attempting to get a dGPU working with the very broken
            Broadcom
            <br>
            controller in the RPi CM4.
            <br>
            Recently they acquired a SoQuartz rk3566 module which is pin
            <br>
            compatible with the CM4, and have taken to trying it out as
            well.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is how I got involved.
            <br>
            It seems they found a trivial way to force the Radeon R600
            driver to
            <br>
            use Non-Cached memory for everything.
            <br>
            This single line change, combined with using memset_io
            instead of
            <br>
            memset, allows the ring tests to pass and the card probes
            successfully
            <br>
            (minus the DMA limitations of the rk356x due to the 32 bit
            <br>
            interconnect).
            <br>
            I discovered using this method that we start having
            unaligned io
            <br>
            memory access faults (bus errors) when running glmark2-drm
            (running
            <br>
            glmark2 directly was impossible, as both X and Wayland
            crashed too
            <br>
            early).
            <br>
            I traced this to using what I thought at the time was an
            unsafe memcpy
            <br>
            in the mesa stack.
            <br>
            Rewriting this function to force aligned writes solved the
            problem and
            <br>
            allows glmark2-drm to run to completion.
            <br>
            With some extensive debugging, I found about half a dozen
            memcpy
            <br>
            functions in mesa that if forced to be aligned would allow
            Wayland to
            <br>
            start, but with hilarious display corruption (see [3]. [4]).
            <br>
            The CM4 team is convinced this is an issue with memcpy in
            glibc, but
            <br>
            I'm not convinced it's that simple.
            <br>
            <br>
            On my two hour drive in to work this morning, I got to
            thinking.
            <br>
            If this was an memcpy fault, this would be universally
            broken on arm64
            <br>
            which is obviously not the case.
            <br>
            So I started thinking, what is different here than with
            systems known to work:
            <br>
            1. No IOMMU for the PCIe controller.
            <br>
            2. The Outer Cache Issue.
            <br>
            <br>
            Robin:
            <br>
            My questions for you, since you're the smartest person I
            know about
            <br>
            arm64 memory management:
            <br>
            Could cache snooping permit unaligned accesses to IO to be
            safe?
            <br>
            Or
            <br>
            Is it the lack of an IOMMU that's causing the ali gnment
            faults to become fatal?
            <br>
            Or
            <br>
            Am I insane here?
            <br>
            <br>
            Rockchip:
            <br>

          Our SoC design team has double check with ARM GIC/ITS IP team
          for many
          <br>
          times, and the GITS_CBASER
          <br>
          of GIC600 IP does not support hardware bind or config to a fix
          value, so
          <br>
          they insist this is an IP

          <br>
          I will check again if we can provide errata for this issue.

        </blockquote>
        Thanks. This is necessary as the mbi-alias provides an imperfect
        <br>
        implementation of the ITS and causes certain PCIe cards (eg x520
        Intel
        <br>
        10G NIC) to misbehave.

        Part of the ITS bug is it expects to be cache coherent with the
        CPU
        <br>
        cluster by design.
        <br>
        Due to the rk356x being implemented without an outer accessible
        cache,
        <br>
        the ITS and other devices that require cache coherency (PCIe for
        <br>
        example) crash in fun ways.
        <br>
      </blockquote>
      Then this is still the ITS issue, not PCIe issue.
      <br>
      PCIe is a peripheral bus controller like USB and other device, the
      driver should maintain the &quot;cache coherency&quot; if there is an=
y, and
      there is no requirement for hardware cache coherency between PCIe
      and CPU.</blockquote>
    <br>
    Well then I suggest to re-read the PCIe specification.<br>
    <br>
    Cache coherency is defined as mandatory there. Non-cache coherency
    is an optional feature.<br>

                          Does your platform support PCIe cache
                          coherency with the CPU?&nbsp; I.e.,
                          <br>
                          does the CPU allow cache snoops from PCIe
                          devices?&nbsp; That is required
                          <br>
                          for the driver to operate.

                        Ah, most likely not.

                        This issue has come up already as the GIC isn't
                        permitted to snoop on
                        <br>
                        the CPUs, so I doubt the PCIe controller can
                        either.

                        <br>
                        Is there no way to work around this or is it

                      It's required by the pcie spec.&nbsp; You could
                      potentially work around it
                      <br>
                      if you can allocate uncached memory for DMA, but I
                      don't think that is

                    There's device_get_dma_attr(), although I don't
                    think it will work
                    <br>
                    currently for PCI devices without an OF or ACPI node
                    - we could
                    <br>
                    perhaps do with a PCI-specific wrapper which can
                    walk up and defer
                    <br>
                    to the host bridge's firmware description as

                    The common DMA ops *do* correctly keep track of

                    <br>
                    internally, but drivers aren't supposed to be poking

                  That sounds like you underestimate the problem. ARM
                  has unfortunately
                  <br>
                  made the coherency for PCI an optional IP.

              stitching together PCIe interconnect IP with a core where
              it is not
              <br>
              supposed to be used with.
              <br>
              <br>
              Do I get that correctly? That's an interesting puzzle
              piece in the picture.

                You expressed interest in &quot;some way to detect if a
                particular platform
                <br>
                supports cache snooping or not&quot;, by which I assumed yo=
u
                meant a
                <br>
                software method for the amdgpu/radeon drivers to call,
                rather than,
                <br>
                say, a website that driver maintainers can look up SoC
                names on. I'm
                <br>
                saying that that API already exists (just may need a bit
                more work).
                <br>
                Note that it is emphatically not a platform-level thing
                since
                <br>
                coherency can and does vary per device within a system.

              Well, I think this is not something an individual driver
              should mess
              <br>
              with. What the driver should do is just express that it
              needs coherent
              <br>
              access to all of system memory and if that is not possible
              fail to load
              <br>
              with a warning why it is not possible.

                interconnect - I
                <br>
                was assuming you'd merely want to do something like
                throw a big
                <br>
                warning and taint the kernel to help triage bug reports.
                Some drivers
                <br>
                like ahci_qoriq and panfrost simply need to know so they
                can program
                <br>
                their device to emit the appropriate memory attributes
                either way, and
                <br>
                rely on the DMA API to hide the rest of the difference,
                but if you
                <br>
                want to treat non-coherent use as unsupported because it
                would require
                <br>
                too invasive changes that's fine by me.
                <br>
              </blockquote>
              Yes exactly that please. I mean not sure how panfrost is
              doing it, but
              <br>
              at least the Vulkan userspace API specification requires
              devices to have
              <br>
              coherent access to system memory.
              <br>
              <br>
              So even if I would want to do this it is simply not
              possible because the
              <br>
              application doesn't tell the driver which memory is
              accessed by the
              <br>
              device and which by the CPU.
