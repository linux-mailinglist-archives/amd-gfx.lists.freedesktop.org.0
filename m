Sounds good.

Considering the non-DC code already didn't add those common modes, I 
think it's reasonable to assume that we would have already heard about 
it if somebody had issues with it.

I guess we'll see if any of those are necessary. For now, I'd propose to 
just consider adding the common modes if there are 0 modes probed. But 
I'm also OK with leaving that for later if you feel it isn't necessary.

A slightly related question, would you be OK with changing the link 
detection code to return dc_connection_none when DDC cannot read an EDID 
header on digital signals, similar to how the non-DC code does it?

I was actually curious about that. I saw that issue while I was working 
on something else. How is it deferred now? Can you point me to the 
series that fixed it?

Agreed.
