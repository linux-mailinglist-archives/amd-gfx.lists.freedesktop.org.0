Hmm, it does work correctly though (with Navi 14) with 180° rotation in gnome-shell, which uses plane rotation for the primary plane and pre-rotated contents for the cursor plane.

This patch results in drmModeAtomicCommit failing and the monitor losing signal instead.


Simon, how did you determine that the HW cursor contents get rotated according to the underlying planes?
