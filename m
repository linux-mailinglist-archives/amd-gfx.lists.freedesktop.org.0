Do you have displays connected to both GPUs?  If you are using X which
ddx are you using?  xf86-video-modesetting or xf86-video-amdgpu?
IIRC, xf86-video-amdgpu has some optimizations for prime which are not
yet in xf86-video-modesetting.  Which GPU is set up as the primary?
Note that the GPU which does the rendering is not necessarily the one
that the displays are attached to.  The render GPU renders to it's
render buffer and then that data may end up being copied other GPUs
for display.  Also, at this point, all shared buffers have to go
through system memory (this will be changing eventually now that we
support device memory via dma-buf), so there is often an extra copy
involved.

This might also be related to which GPU is the primary.  It still may
be the integrated GPU since that is what is attached to the laptop
panel.  Also the platform and some drivers may do certain things when
the lid is closed.  E.g., for thermal reasons, the integrated GPU or
CPU may have a more limited TDP because the laptop cannot cool as
efficiently.
