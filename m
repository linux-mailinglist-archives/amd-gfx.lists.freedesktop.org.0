Thinking about this more, I think the problem might be related to CPU
access to "VRAM".  APUs don't have dedicated VRAM, they use a reserved
carve out region at the top of system memory.  For CPU access to this
memory, we kmap the physical address of the carve out region of system
memory.  You'll need to make sure that region is accessible to the
guest.
