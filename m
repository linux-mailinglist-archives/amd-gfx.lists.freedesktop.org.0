I applied patch v5 and the above ASSERT patch, on top of both Linux=20
5.16-rc8 and 5.16.

Result: no problems with suspend/resume, 16+ cycles.

As far as the hang goes:

I plugged in an HDMI cable connected to my TV, and configured Gnome to=20
use the external display only.

connectors from /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/state:

connector[78]: eDP-1
 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0crtc=3D(null)
 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0self_refresh_aware=3D0
connector[85]: HDMI-A-1
 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0crtc=3Dcrtc-1
 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0self_refresh_aware=3D0
connector[89]: DP-1
 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0crtc=3D(null)
 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0self_refresh_aware=3D0

I manually unplugged/plugged the HDMI cable 16+ times, and also ran:

$ sudo sh -c 'for ((i=3D0;i<100;i++)); do echo 1 | tee=20
/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/HDMI-A-1/trigger_hotplug; sleep 3; done'

The system did not hang, and I saw no kernel log output from the ASSERT.

I also tried a USB-C dock with an HDMI port, with the same results,=20
though there are other issues with this (perhaps worthy of other bug=20
reports).

Is there some reason to use amd-staging-drm-next for this test?

I don't use the HDMI connection much and I have never experienced a hang=20
with HDMI in the first place. Can someone send a link to an=20
issue/discussion where this hang is being discussed?
