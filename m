That's what I'm asking: Is this for some tool or to make some driver 
decision based on it?

If you just want the numbers for over displaying then I think it would 
be better to put this into fdinfo together with the other existing stuff 
there.

If you want to make allocation decisions based on this then we should 
have that as IOCTL or even better as mmap() page between kernel and 
userspace. But in this case I would also calculation the numbers 
completely different as well.

See we have at least the following things in the kernel:
1. The eviction list in the VM.
     Those are the BOs which are currently evicted and tried to moved 
back in on the next CS.

2. The VRAM over commit value.
     In other words how much more VRAM than available has the 
application tried to allocate?

3. The visible VRAM usage by this application.

The end goal is that the eviction list will go away, e.g. we will always 
have stable allocations based on allocations of other applications and 
not constantly swap things in and out.

When you now expose the eviction list to userspace we will be stuck with 
this interface forever.

Christian.
