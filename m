Per my comments on the bug report, did you also update mesa or GPU
firmware?  If so, can you narrow down if any of those other components
had an impact?  Alternatively, can you bisect the kernel?  If you have
known good and bad kernels, it would be really helpful if you could
bisect to identify what commit caused the regression for you.
