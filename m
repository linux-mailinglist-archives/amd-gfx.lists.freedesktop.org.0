Yeah I think that's perfectly ok, and probably worth it to still optimize
for tiled->tiled changes. If you can. tiled<->untiled only happens for
boot-splash, so no one cares, but with modifiers the idea is that tiling
changes (especially once we get into the different compression modes
amdgpu support, and which Bas' series tries to enable) are fairly common
and should be doable without any stalls anywhere.
