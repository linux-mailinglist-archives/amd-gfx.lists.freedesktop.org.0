> I might misunderstood your requirement . For live migration, it's =
transparent  to the guest.  The guest can be  in running  state (ex. =
like running  some compute stuff),  hypervisor     and gim driver =
together will handle the GPU HW state migration from source vGPU to =
other  identical  vGPU .  It doesn't requires the guest to do the =
suspend/resume.  You can contact other engineers that work on SRIOV for =
more live  migration support info.
Yeah, there are different usage scenarios:
1) live migration
2) hibernate/suspend/resume
3) snapshot and clone
Currently we are focusing on live migration and hibernation, and hope =
that we can base on common underlying technologies.
