Dear Alex,

First of all, thank you for your response. Personally, I use a Ryzen 5 7600=
X however people with a Ryzen 9 7900X are also reporting this issue. The re=
levant bug report in Mangohud can be found here: "https://github.com/flight=
lessmango/MangoHud/issues/868".

I looked around a bit in both the Mangohud source code and the Linux kernel=
 source code.

(Mangohud source): From what I understand, Mangohud looks for a file "/sys/=
class/drm/card*/device/gpu_metrics". If this file exists (and it does exist=
s on my machine), it tries to read this file and extract the relevant GPU d=
ata (and in case of an APU also the CPU data) from it (these are the values=
 I was talking about in my previous mail). When the file "/sys/class/drm/ca=
rd*/device/gpu_metrics" exists, it will not use the data provided by hwmon =
(/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/*).

(Linux kernel): The gpu_metrics file contains different data, depending on =
what version is used. All valid versions can be found in the source code: "=
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/=
kgd_pp_interface.h#L725". For my CPU/APU the 'gpu_metrics_v2_1' structure i=
s used (I tested this by reading the gpu_metrics file myself). Furthermore,=
 I think that for my case, this structure is set by the function "https://e=
lixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/pm/swsmu/smu13/sm=
u_v13_0_5_ppt.c#L459" but I am not completely sure about this.

Lastly, I am not familiar with umr. I assume that you are referring to "htt=
ps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/tomstdenis/umr"? If I find some time this weeke=
nd, then I will look into this some more.

Kind regards,
sfrcorne
