well, as far as I know that is a clear violation of the PCIe specification.

Coherent access to system memory is simply a must have.

Yeah, you basically just force it into AGP mode :)

There is just absolutely no guarantee that this works reliable.

Yes exactly that.

Both OpenGL and Vulkan allow the application to mmap() device memory and 
do any memory access they want with that.

This means that changing memcpy is just a futile effort, it's still 
possible for the application to make an unaligned memory access and that 
is perfectly valid.

Oh, very good point. I would be interested in that as answer as well.

Christian.
