I've added the relevant pci probing debug output without assign-busses
and the lspci -vvvv for a boot with all devices visible.

I was referring to the work outlined in
https://ostconf.com/system/attachments/files/000/001/698/original/Sergei_Mi=
roshnichenko_linux_piter_2019_presentation.pdf?1570136708
for nvme enclosures. Which maybe referncing more the movable BARs than
the renumbering that occurs with assign-busses, but also on power with
device trees which may behave differently as it mentions assign-busses
to get this same renumbering of buses. This makes me think at least
modern non-x86 devices expect to behave this way, which may not be
relevant to ACPI/x86 systems but at least this shared pci code should
be solid.

> I'm not sure yet what's going wrong with the Thunderbold controller, but =

I agree, it is just what is currently available in the kernel. A less
disruptive approach seems needed.
