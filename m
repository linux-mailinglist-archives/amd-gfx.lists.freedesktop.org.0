Thanks Alex,
Here's my plan:

since my laptop's os is pretty customized, e.g. compiling my own kernel,
building latest xorg, latest xorg-driver-amdgpu, etc etc,
im going to use the intel iommu and pass through my rx 5600 into a virtual
machine, which will be a 100% stock ubuntu installation.
then, inside that vm, i will continue to debug

does that sound like it would make sense for testing? for example, with
that scenario, it adds the iommu into the mix, so who knows if that causes
performance issues. but i think its worth a shot, to see if a stock kernel
will handle it better

also, quick question:
from what i understand, a thunderbolt 3 pci express connection should
handle 8 GT/s x4, however, along the chain of bridges to my device, i
notice that the bridge closest to the graphics card is at 2.5 GT/s x4, and
it also says "downgraded" (this is via the lspci output)

now, when i boot into windows, it _also_ says 2.5 GT/s x4, and it runs
extremely well. no issues at all.

so my question is: the fact that the bridge is at 2.5 GT/s x4, and not at
its theoretical "full link speed" of 8 GT/s x4, do you suppose that _could_
be an issue?
i do not think so, because, like i said, in windows it also reports that
link speed.
i would assume that you would want the fastest link speed possible, because
i would assume that of _all_ tb3 pci express devices, a GPU would be the #1
most demanding on the link

just curious if you think 2.5 GT/s could be the bottleneck

i will pass through the device into a ubuntu vm and let you know how it
goes. thanks

&gt; thanks for the answers alex.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; so, i went ahead and got a displayport cable to see if that changes<br=

&gt; anything. and now, when i run monitor only, and the monitor connected<=
br>
&gt; to the card, it has no issues like before! so i am thinking that<br>
&gt; somethings up with either the hdmi cable, or some hdmi related setting=
<br>
&gt; in my system? who knows, but im just gonna roll with only using<br>
&gt; displayport cables now.<br>
&gt; the previous hdmi cable was actually pretty long, because i was<br>
&gt; extending it with an hdmi extension cable, so maybe the signal was<br>
&gt; really bad or something :/<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; but yea, i guess the only real issue now is maybe something simple<br>
&gt; related to some sysfs entry about enabling some powermode, voltage,<br=
>
&gt; clock frequency, or something, so that glxgears will give me more than=
<br>
&gt; 300 fps. but atleast now i can use a single monitor configuration with=
<br>
&gt; the monitor displayported up to the card.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
The GPU dynamically adjusts the clocks and voltages based on load.=C2=A0 No=
<br>
manual configuration is required.<br>
<br>
At this point, we probably need to see you xorg log and dmesg output<br>
to try and figure out exactly what is going on.=C2=A0 I still suspect there=
<br>
is some interaction going on with both GPUs and the integrated GPU<br>
being the primary, so as I mentioned before, you should try and run X<br>
on just the amdgpu rather than trying to use both of them.<br>
<br>
Alex<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; also, one other thing i think you might be interested in, that was<br>
&gt; happening before.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; so, previously, with laptop -tb3-&gt; egpu-hdmi&gt; monitor, there was=
 a<br>
&gt; funny thing happening which i never could figure out.<br>
&gt; when i would look at the X logs, i would see that &quot;modesetting&qu=
ot; (for<br>
&gt; the intel integrated graphics) was reporting that MonitorA was used<br=
>
&gt; with &quot;eDP-1&quot;,=C2=A0 which is correct and what i expected.<br=
>
&gt; when i scrolled further down, i then saw that &quot;HDMI-A-1-2&quot; w=
as being<br>
&gt; used for another MonitorB, which also is what i expected (albeit i<br>
&gt; have no idea why its saying A-1-2)<br>
&gt; but amdgpu was _also_ saying that DisplayPort-1-2 (a port on the<br>
&gt; radeon card) was being used for MonitorA, which is the same Monitor<br=
>
&gt; that the modesetting driver had claimed to be using with eDP-1!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; so the point is that amdgpu was &quot;using&quot; Monitor0 with Displa=
yPort-1-2,<br>
&gt; although that is what modesetting was using for eDP-1.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; anyway, thats a little aside, i doubt it was related to the terrible<b=
r>
&gt; hdmi experience i was getting, since its about display port and stuff,=
<br>
&gt; but i thought id let you know about that.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; if you think that is a possible issue, im more than happy to plug the<=
br>
&gt; hdmi setup back in and create an issue on gitlab with the logs and<br>
&gt; everything<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; lol youre quick!<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Windows has supported peer to peer DMA for years so it=
 already has a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; numbers of optimizations that are only now becoming possible=
 on Linux&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whoa, i figured linux would be ahead of windows when it come=
s to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; things like that. but peer-to-peer dma is something that is =
only<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recently possible on linux, but has been possible on windows=
? what<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; changed recently that allows for peer to peer dma in linux?<=
br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; A few things that made this more complicated on Linux:<br>
&gt; &gt; 1. Linux uses IOMMUs more extensively than windows so you can&#39=
;t just<br>
&gt; &gt; pass around physical bus addresses.<br>
&gt; &gt; 2. Linux supports lots of strange architectures that have a lot o=
f<br>
&gt; &gt; limitations with respect to peer to peer transactions<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; It just took years to get all the necessary bits in place in Linu=
x and<br>
&gt; &gt; make everyone happy.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; also, in the context of a game running opengl on some gpu, i=
s the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; dma transfer something like: the ga=
me draw&#39;s to some<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; memory it has allocated, then a DMA transfer gets that and m=
oves it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; into the graphics card output?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Peer to peer DMA just lets devices access another devices local m=
emory<br>
&gt; &gt; directly.=C2=A0 So if you have a buffer in vram on one device, yo=
u can<br>
&gt; &gt; share that directly with another device rather than having to cop=
y it<br>
&gt; &gt; to system memory first.=C2=A0 For example, if you have two GPUs, =
you can<br>
&gt; &gt; have one of them copy it&#39;s content directly to a buffer in th=
e other<br>
&gt; &gt; GPU&#39;s vram rather than having to go through system memory fir=
st.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; also, i know it can be super annoying trying to debug an iss=
ue like<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this, with someone like me who has all types of differences =
from a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; normal setup (e.g. using it via egpu, using a kernel with cu=
stom<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; configs and stuff) so as a token of my appreciation i donate=
d 50$ to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the red cross&#39; corona virus outbreak charity thing, on b=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just a couple more questions:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - based on what you are aware of, the technical de=
tails such as<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shared buffers go through system memory&quot=
;, and all that, do you see<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any issues that might exist that i might be missin=
g in my setup? i<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cant imagine this being the case because the card =
works great in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; windows, unless the windows driver does something =
different?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Windows has supported peer to peer DMA for years so it =
already has a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; numbers of optimizations that are only now becoming pos=
sible on Linux.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - as far as kernel config, is there anything in pa=
rticular which<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _should_ or _should not_ be enabled/disabled?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;ll need the GPU drivers for your devices and dm=
a-buf support.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - does the vendor matter? for instance, this is an=
 xfx card. when it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes to different vendors, are there interface ch=
anges that might<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make one vendor work better for linux than another=
? i dont really<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand the differences in vendors, but i imagi=
ne that the vbios<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differs between vendors, and as such, the linux co=
mpatibility would<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe change?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; board vendor shouldn&#39;t matter.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - is the pcie bandwidth possible an issue? the pci=
e_bw file changes<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between values like this:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 18446683600662707640 18446744071581623085 128<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sometimes i see this:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4096 0 128<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as you can see, the second value seems significant=
ly lower. is that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possibly an issue? possibly due to aspm?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pcie_bw is not implemented for navi yet so you are just=
 seeing<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uninitialized data.=C2=A0 This patch set should clear t=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and what are the shared buffers youre referri=

if so, thats fine, right?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because the application&#39;s memory is in sy=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldnt be an issue.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in general, do you think the &quot;copy buffe=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and for what its worth, when i turn the displ=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theres another really weird issue..=
.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given setup 1, where the monitor is=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when i close the laptop lid, my mon=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can &quot;use it&quot; in a sense<b=

the screen are delayed by about 2<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or 3 seconds.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is to say, its as if the lapto=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open a terminal, the terminal will =
open, but it will take 2 seconds<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its almost as if all the frames and=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the laptop is running fine and ever=
ything, but i simply just dont get<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see it on the monitor, except fo=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its hard to articulate, because its=
 so bizarre. its not like, a &quot;low<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fps&quot; per se, because the curso=
r is totally smooth. but its that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _everything else_ is only updated o=
nce every couple seconds.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This might also be related to which GPU =
is the primary.=C2=A0 It still may<br>
