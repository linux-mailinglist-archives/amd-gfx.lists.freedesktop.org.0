I guess we could do a drm_pci_dev_enter which combines drm_dev_enter +
pci_dev_is_connected. Not perfect, but well then the only real
solution is just unconditionaly drm_dev_unplug in ->remove. I think if
we do an additional developer_mode module parameter, and if that's not
explicitly set, ignore the pci_dev_is_disconnected and just always
call drm_dev_unplug() that would be about as good as it gets.
