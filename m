What other ways do you (or future AMD developers) have then? (I would 
also use *helpful* or *useful*.)

(In two years, when maybe nobody of the current AMD developers work at 
AMD anymore, and a user bisects a problems to this patch I could imagine 
it would help the future AMD developers to have this connection.)

Thank you for clarifying, but I am not interested in the hardware 
details, but how to reproduce and test the issue. And according to Lang 
this information is present in the issue. Seeing how complex the 
graphics driver are, a lot of documentation is not publicly available, a 
recipe to manually reproduce and test the issue is most helpful.


Kind regards,

Paul
