Hello everyone,

patch by user @fililip was posted there, but not submitted:

"I think I'd have to submit it to the linux kernel mailing list, which I 
am kinda scared of ðŸ˜…. It could be better to submit that patch to Arch 
Linux maintainers; they could include it in their kernel builds."

Implementation of this patch can be simplified by simply setting:

smu->min_power_limit = amdgpu_ignore_min_pcap ? 0 : whatever_default_smuxx;

and then leave rest of the code unchanged(except defining 
amdgpu_ignore_min_pcap variable of course). Nothing tricky nor need to 
revert anything should be needed I hope. Please add it to the general 
kernel as an option, it certainly should not be related to Archlinux only.

Roman
