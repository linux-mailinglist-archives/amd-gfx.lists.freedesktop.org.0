Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

I still have this issue on my list of tracked regressions.

Was this fixed in between? Doesn't look like it from here, but I might
be missing something.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.
