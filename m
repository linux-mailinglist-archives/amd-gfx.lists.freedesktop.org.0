Hi Christian & Marek,

I'd be happy to submit a new patch series if we can agree on what the
limits are for each SDMA version and how to get the best performance
from it.

I trust Marek's word that he did his research when he came up with
0x3fff00 so I don't understand the pushback here.

(1) According to a conversation between Marek and myself, the most
optimal way to program the SDMA would be to use 256-byte-aligned copy
packets. Christian, do you agree with this? If yes, I can write a patch
for that. If not, let me know what you would prefer.

(2) I'd like us to come to an agreement on the maximum amount of bytes
copied per SDMA packet, and align the kernel code with Mesa. At the
moment, the maximum limit is different for every SDMA version between
the kernel and Mesa, which makes the whole topic super confusing.

Please keep in mind that if there is any chance that the current limit
is indeed incorrect (as it sounds like it is), we risk "random" SDMA
hangs on users' machines.

Thanks & best regards,
Timur
