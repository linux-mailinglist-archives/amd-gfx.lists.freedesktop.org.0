The old DEVICE_PUBLIC mostly different in that it allowed the page
to be returned from vm_normal_page, which I think was horribly buggy.

But the point is not to bring back these old semantics.  The idea
is to be able to differeniate between your new coherent on-device
memory and the existing DEVICE_GENERIC.  That is call the
code in free_devmap_managed_page that is currently only used
for device private pages also for your new public device pages without
affecting the devdax and xen use cases.
