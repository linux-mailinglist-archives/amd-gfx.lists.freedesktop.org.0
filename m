Yeah completely agree. Additional to that the combine behavior between 
USWC and WB is the same, so the argumentation is clearly not correct.

What happens instead is that the broken KVM patch applies the guest 
caching attributes to the ring buffer instead of the host ones.

Making an educated guess I would say that the root of the problem is 
that the guest is using some incorrect caching attributes for some 
reason, which is exactly the same reason why that KVM patch was revert 
upstream as well.

Christian.
