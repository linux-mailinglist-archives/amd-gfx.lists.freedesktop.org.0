Sounds good. What do you think, Siquiera?

I think they are worth a sentence or two each in the glossary.

When trying to diagnose problems (eg. GPU hangs), we often need to look
at various HW registers (eg. GRBM_STATUS), which refer to the above
sub-blocks. It is then hard to see what is going on without knowing
what these are. In turn, that makes it hard to come up with an
understanding that can explain what is happening on the HW.

I agree and I think most (all?) of these are already in the glossary.
If not, they should be definitely added.

Thanks & best regards,
