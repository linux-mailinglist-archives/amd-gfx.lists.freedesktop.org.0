That's not what anyone's saying here ...

No-one's demanding AMD publish RTL, or internal design docs, or
hardware specs, or URLs to JIRA tickets no-one can access.

This is a large and invasive commit with pretty big ramifications;
containing exactly two lines of commit message, one of which just
duplicates the subject.

It cannot be the case that it's completely impossible to provide any
justification, background, or details, about this commit being made.
Unless, of course, it's to fix a non-public security issue, that is
reasonable justification for eliding some of the details. But then
again, 'huge change which is very deliberately opaque' is a really
good way to draw a lot of attention to the commit, and it would be
better to provide more detail about the change to help it slip under
the radar.

If dri-devel@ isn't allowed to inquire about patches which are posted,
then CCing the list is just a fa=C3=A7ade; might as well just do it all
internally and periodically dump out pull requests.

Cheers,
Daniel
