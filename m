Kever,

These issues are one and the same.
Certain hardware blocks *require* cache coherency as part of their design.
All of the *interesting* things PCIe can do stem from it.

When I saw you bumped the available window to the PCIe controller to
1GB I was really excited, because that meant we could finally support
devices that used these interesting features.
However, without cache coherency, having more than a 256MB window is a
waste, as any card that can take advantage of it *requires* coherency.
The same thing goes for a resizable BAR.
EP mode is the same, having the ability to connect one CPU to another
CPU over a PCIe bus loses the advantages when you don't have
coherency.
At that point, you might as well toss in a 2.5GB ethernet port and
just use that instead.

It's easy to reproduce, just try to use any card that has a
significantly large enough BAR to warrant requiring coherency.
dGPUs are the most readily accessible device, but High Performance
Computing Acceleration devices and high power FPGAs also would work.
Was the resizable bar tested at all internally either?
Any current device that could use that requires coherency.
And like above, EP mode without coherency is a waste at best, and
unpleasant at worst.

Very Respectfully,
Peter
