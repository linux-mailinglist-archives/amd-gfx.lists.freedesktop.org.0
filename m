Well, that partially correct. The efifb is using the PCIe resources to 
access the framebuffer and as far as I know we use that one to kick it out.

The stolen memory we get over e820/registers is separate to that.

No, it isn't. You are probably just still seeing the same screen.

The issue is most likely that while efi was kicked out nobody 
re-programmed the display hardware to show something different.

You assumption with the black screen is incorrect. Since the hardware 
works independent even if you kick out efi you still have the same 
screen content, you just can't update it anymore.

But putting efi asside what Alex pointed out pretty much breaks your 
neck trying to forward the device. You maybe could try to hack the 
driver to use the PCIe BAR for framebuffer access, but that might be 
quite a bit slower.

Regards,
Christian.
