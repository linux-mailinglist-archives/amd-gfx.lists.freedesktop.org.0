I will have to look into that to provide an answer.

Then again it is limited to specific old SKU so maybe it should not be that controversial either? Only that Christian NAKed tying it to job lifetime. So I don't know, AMDs call.

SMU stuff, as far as I can follow it, ends up with simply sending some 
messages to the firmware. So I am not sure what and how could be 
optimised there.

Increasing GFX_OFF_DELAY_ENABLED would work, if large enough, but I 
think it could be bad for power usage, depending on the workload.

> On the other hand why does it help to keep GFXOFF disabled while running the SDMA job?

Only because I tied it to both GFX and SDMA.

RFC does this:

1) Marks SDMA as "needs GFXOFF workaround".
2) Propagates "needs GFXOFF workaround" to adev if any active ring has 
it set.
3) If adev has it set, it grabs and extra GFXOFF disable for GFX, 
COMPUTE and SDMA submissions, and marks those jobs as "hold GFXOFF".
4) Releases the GFXOFF when marked jobs are "completed" (well freed, 
since completion is IRQ context so hard).

AFAIU from what Alex said I understood the parts of the chip handling 
GFX and SDMA (not sure about compute) are under the same "power gating 
domain" (right name?).

What would you suggest to log power use during the game? Something like 
once per second or so?

Tvrtko
