Seems reasonable to me

What I've seen is that this only works with customer demand. Companies
need to hear from their customers that upstream is what is needed, and
companies cannot properly hear that until they are at least already
partially invested in the upstream process and have the right
customers that are sophisticated enough to care.

Embedded makes everything 10x worse because too many customers just
don't care about upstream, you can hack your way through everything,
and indulge in single generation thinking. Fork the whole kernel for 3
years, EOL, no problem!

It is the enterprise world, particularly with an opinionated company
like RH saying NO stuck in the middle that really seems to drive
things toward upstream.

Yes, vendors can work around Red Hat's No (and NVIDIA GPU is such an
example) but it is incredibly time consuming, expensive and becoming
more and more difficult every year.

The big point is this:

I think this is at the core of Linux's success in the enterprise
world. Big customers who care demanding open source. Any vendor, even
nvidia will want to meet customer demands.

IHMO upstream success is found by motivating the customer to demand
and make it "easy" for the vendor to supply it.
