I choose nouveau because of this:

$ git ls-files drivers/gpu/drm/arm/ | xargs wc -l
 15039 total
$ git ls-files drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/ | xargs wc -l
 204198 total

At 13x the size of mali this is not just some easy to wire up memory
manager and command submission. And after all that typing it still
isn't very good. The fully supported AMD vendor driver is over 3
million lines, so nouveau probably needs to grow several times.

My argument is that an in-tree open kernel driver is a big help to
reverse engineering an open userspace. Having the vendors
collaboration to build that monstrous thing can only help the end goal
of an end to end open stack.

For instance a vendor with an in-tree driver has a strong incentive to
sort out their FW licensing issues so it can be redistributed.

I'm not sure about this all or nothing approach. AFAIK DRM has the
worst problems with out of tree drivers right now.

I don't think much of the out of tree but open drivers. The goal must
be to get vendors in tree.

I would applaud Habana for getting an intree driver at least, even if
the userspace is not what we'd all want to see.

The internet tells me there is nvgpu, it doesn't seem to have helped.
