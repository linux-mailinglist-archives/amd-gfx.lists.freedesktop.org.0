That's what the innocuous "a.o." wanted to state. :)

Hmm, and in passthrough mode it would use bounce buffers when SME is
enabled. And when those 256K are not enough, it would fail there too,
even with IOMMUv2. At least this is how it looks from here.

Dunno, it feels like doing GPU compute and SME does not go hand-in-hand
real smoothly currently but that probably doesn't matter all too much
for both user camps. But that's just me with a hunch.

Thing is, we don't know at SME init time - very early during boot -
whether we're Epyc or client. Can we find that out reliably from the hw?

And even if we do, that's still not accurate enough - we wanna know
whether the IOMMU works.

So I guess we're all left to the user to decide. But I'm always open
to suggestions for solving things in sw and not requiring any user
interaction.

Thx.
