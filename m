Each SoC is made up of hardware blocks that provide various different
functionality.  They are mostly independent and mostly initialized
independently.  I'm not sure what you would want to check.  In your
case, I don't think it's an issue of the chip not being functional
overall, but rather a problem specific to the failing block somehow
related to being in a virtualized environment.
