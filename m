The patch posted by Luben will cause double free in some cases.

Subject: [PATCH] kobject: Add kset_put() if kset_register() fails
X-check-string-leak: v1.0

If kset_register() fails, we call kset_put() before returning the
error. This makes sure that we free memory allocated by kobj_set_name()
for the kset, since kset_register() cannot be called unless the kset has
a name, usually gotten via kobj_set_name(&kset->kobj, format, ...);
