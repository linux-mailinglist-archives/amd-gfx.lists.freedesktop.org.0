Sure, but that is the point, isn't it? To have an actually useful

So the argument with Habana really boils down to how much do they need
to show in the open source space to get a kernel driver? You want to
see the ISA or compiler at least?

That at least doesn't seem "extreme" to me.

Right, companies have no incentive to work in a sane way if they have
their own parallel world. I think drawing them part by part into the
standard open workflows and expectations is actually helpful to
everyone.

I understand nvgpu is the tegra driver that people actualy
use. nouveau may have good tegra support but is it used in any actual
commercial product?
