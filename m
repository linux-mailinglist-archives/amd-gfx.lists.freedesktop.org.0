Similar to i915 just that we don't inspect buffers but expose the 
instance capabilities and userspace is responsible to set up the load 
balancing engine with the correct physical mask.

Anyway, back to the main point - are you interested at all for me to add 
the capacity flags to at least the IP blocks which are probed to exist 
more than a singleton? And if yes, could you please suggest how to do it.

For instance should I use adev->sdma.num_instances, 
adev->uvd.num_uvd_inst, adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst, 
adev->jpeg.num_jpeg_inst? Or maybe adev->num_ip_blocks and count by 
hw_ip type?

Patch 3/5 interesting or not to skip all the empty array walking (in 
amdgpu_ctx_entity_time mostly)?

Regards,

Tvrtko
