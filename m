I compared the two of them.
There are different problems you have with USB during recovery in the 
bad, but I don't think that's relevant.
The only thing different from a display perspective is a slight 
difference to the timing.

Can you repeat once more with /sys/power/pm_debug_messages and 
/sys/power/pm_print_times set for good and bad?  I want to make sure the 
device suspend order is identical.

Also; does playing audio leading up to the suspend cycle influence 
anything (both on good and bad kernel)?
