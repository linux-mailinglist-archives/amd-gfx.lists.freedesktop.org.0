Is that the last working or the first broken?

The last kernel in Debian 11 (i.e. buster) is 5.10.218-1. Or do you mean
the last in buster-security which would be 5.10.244-1? Or do you mean
the one that Debian 11.0 was released with, that would be 5.10.46-4 (I
think)?

The kernels before and after that are depending on what you meant above
5.10.216-1 or 5.10.237-1 or 5.10.46-3 and 5.10.221-1 or
5.13.9-1~exp1 or 5.10.46-5. Which one do you mean?

The gist to take away here is: Don't specify kernel versions as "the one
in Debian 11" or "kernel 5" but use the proper kernel (package) version.
Everything else is too fuzzy for me to work with.

That depends on the answers for the questions I already asked and that
are still not answered in a way that I can ask the followup questions.

Right, and I doubt it's yours either. Or you would be the first native
English speaker in my career that I fail to understand when
communicating about Linux topics. (The only other explanations for that
I can come up with are a) you suffer from dyslexia; or b) you write
glibberish on purpose to annoy.)

PSA: This is my last mail to you for this bug until you come up with a
statement like:

	I tested Debian kernel image package version a.b.c-d and its
	broken with the following symptoms: [....]. The kernel image
	that occurs in the list on
	https://snapshot.debian.org/package/linux/ directly after that
	(i.e. version e.f.g-h) doesn't show these symptoms.

Best regards
Uwe
