Hi David,

Thank you for your feedback!

Initially, we tried the kunit_test_suites() approach. And it did work pretty well for the kunit_tool (although we didn't test any hardware-specific unit test). But when compiling the test as a module, we would get a linking error, pointing out multiple definitions of 'init_module'/'cleanup_module' at kunit_test_suites().

At this point, we thought about a couple of options to resolve this problem:
- Add EXPORT_SYMBOL to the functions we would test. But, this doesn't scale pretty well, because it would pollute AMDGPU code as the tests expand.
- Take the Thunderbolt path and add the tests to the driver stack.

We end up taking the Thunderbolt path as it would be more maintainable.

Compiling the tests as a module is essential to make the tests run at IGT, as IGT essentially loads the module, runs it, and parses the output (a very very simplified explanation of what IGT does). IGT is a very known tool for DRI developers, so we believe that IGT support is crucial for this project.

If you have any other options on how to make the module compilation viable without using the 'thunderbolt'-style, we would be glad to hear your suggestions.

We hope to see in the near future the improved module support from KUnit as it would make the addition of tests much more simple and clean.

Could you explain more about what is missing to make this improved module support come upstream?

Thank you for the suggestion! We will change the KUNIT dependency.
