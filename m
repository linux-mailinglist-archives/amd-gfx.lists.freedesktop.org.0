Because operation outside of the design bounding box is undefined.  It
might work for some boards but not others.  It's possible some of the
logic in the firmware or some of the components used on the board may
not work correctly below a certain limit, or the voltage regulators
used on a specific board have a minimum requirement that would not be
an issue if you stick the bounding box.
