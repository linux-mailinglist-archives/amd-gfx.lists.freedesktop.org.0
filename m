Hi Simon,

Siqueria explained a bit below, but the problem is that we don't have 
dedicated cursor planes in hardware.

It's easiest to under the hardware cursor as being constrained within 
the DRM plane specifications. Each DRM plane maps to 1 (or 2) hardware 
pipes and the cursor has to be drawn along with it. The cursor will 
inherit the scale, bounds, and color management associated with the 
underlying pipes.

 From the kernel display driver perspective that makes things quite 
difficult with the existing DRM API - we can only really guarantee you 
get HW cursor when the framebuffer covers the entire screen and it is 
unscaled or matches the scaling expected by the user.

Hole punching generally satisfies both of these since it's a transparent 
framebuffer that covers the entire screen.

The case that's slightly more complicated is when the overlay doesn't 
cover the entire screen but the primary plane does. We can still enable 
the cursor if the primary plane and overlay have a matching scale and 
color management - our display hardware can draw the cursor on multiple 
pipes. (Note: this statement only applies for DCN2.1+)

If the overlay plane does not cover the entire screen and the scale or 
the color management differs then we cannot enable the HW cursor plane. 
As you mouse over the bounds of the overlay you will see the cursor 
drawn differently on the primary and overlay pipe.

If the overlay plane and primary plane do not cover the entire screen 
then you will lose HW cursor outside of the union of their bounds.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your usecase [1] falls under the 
category where:
1. Primary plane covers entire screen
2. Overlay plane does not cover the entire screen
3. Overlay plane is scaled

This isn't a support configuration because HW cursor cannot be drawn in 
the same position on both pipes.

I think you can see a similar usecase to [1] on Windows, but the 
difference is that the cursor is drawn on the "primary plane" instead of 
on top of the primary and overlay. I don't remember if DRM has a 
requirement that the cursor plane must be topmost, but we can't enable 
[1] as long as it is.

I don't know if you have more usecases in mind than [1], but just as 
some general recommendations I think you should only really use overlays 
when they fall under one of two categories:

1. You want to save power:

You will burn additional power for the overlay pipe.

But you will save power in use cases like video playback - where the 
decoder produces the framebuffer and we can avoid a shader composited 
copy with its associated GFX engine overhead and memory traffic.

2. You want more performance:

You will burn additional power for the overlay pipe.

On bandwidth constrained systems you can save significant memory 
bandwidth by avoiding the shader composition by allowing for direct 
scanout of game or other application buffers.

Your usecase [1] falls under this category, but as an aside I discourage 
trying to design usecases where the compositor requires the overlay for 
functional purposes.

Best regards,
Nicholas Kazlauskas
