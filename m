Dear Alex,

If current_gfxclk is not supported for my CPU, then using average_gfxclk_fr=
equency instead is indeed the best solution in my opinion. I will try to ge=
t a fix merged for my CPU in Mangohud.

On a side note: you mentioned that unsupported fields would be 0 but I don'=
t think this is correct. In the Linux kernel/driver there is a line of code=
 that first set all values to 0xFF by a memset() and then populates the sup=
ported fields.

see "https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/pm/=
swsmu/smu_cmn.c#L999": memset(header, 0xFF, structure_size);

The value of the unsupported uint16_t fields thus should be 0xFFFF (or 6553=
5 in decimal). This is also what I get when reading the gpu_metrics file. I=
 just wanted to mention this in case someone reads this in the Archive.

Anyway, thank you for your help!

Kind regards,
sfrcorne
