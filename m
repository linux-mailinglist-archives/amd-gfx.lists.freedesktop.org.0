Right.  There are some 4K pages with the MMIO register BAR which are
empty and registers can be remapped into them.  In this case we remap
the HDP flush registers into one of those register pages.  This allows
applications to flush the HDP write FIFO from either the CPU or
another device.  This is needed to flush data written by the CPU or
another device to the VRAM BAR out to VRAM (i.e., so the GPU can see
it).  This is flushed internally as part of the shader dispatch
packets, but there are certain cases where an application may want
more control.  This is probably not a showstopper for most ROCm apps.
That said, the region is only 4K so if you allow applications to map a
larger region they would get access to GPU register pages which they
shouldn't have access to.
