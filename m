See how smca_get_long_name() is exported and export that function the
same way.

To save you some energy: is_smca_umc_v2() is not going to happen.

An EDAC "device", as you call it, is not interested in handling UEs. If
anything, it counts them.

Is that the same deferred interrupt which calls amd_deferred_error_interrupt() ?

What page is that? Normal DRAM page or a page in some special GPU memory?

We do that for normal DRAM memory pages by poisoning them. I hope you
don't mean that.

Looking at

amdgpu_ras_add_bad_pages
|-> amdgpu_vram_mgr_reserve_range

that's some VRAM thing so I'm guessing special memory on the GPU.

If so, what happens with all those "retired" pages when you reboot?
They're getting used again and potentially trigger the same UEs and the
same retiring happens?

Ok, I'm a user and I can access that information through sysfs. What can
I do with it?

It is getting there.

Thx.
