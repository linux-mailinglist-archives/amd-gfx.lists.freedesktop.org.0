Which is another goddamn layering violation of a subsystem that has no

I doubt it.  At least if you had actually talked to the relevant people.
Which seems to be a major issue with what is going on GPU land.

Awesome!  I have a bit of related work on the DMA mapping subsystems, so
let's sync up as soon as you have some first sketches.

Btw, one thing I noticed when looking over the dma-buf instances is that
there is a lot of duplicated code for creating a sg_table from pages,
and then mapping it.  It would be good if we could move toward common
helpers instead of duplicating that all over again.
