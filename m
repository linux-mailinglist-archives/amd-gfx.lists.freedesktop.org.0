The core memory management can wait at any time for the GPU reset to finish.

If we set the timeout to infinity we risk just deadlocking the kernel.

See here as well: https://lpc.events/event/11/contributions/1115/

Yeah, I'm perfectly aware of that. The problem is this is just *not* 
supported on Linux for graphics shaders.

What you can do is to run the shader with something like CWSR enabled 
(or an to be invented graphics equivalent). Since we are debugging the 
shader anyway that should be possible I think.

Well, I think you misunderstood me. The suggestion was even to force 
them to re-compile the kernel driver to disable GPU recovery.

Disabling GPU recovery is *not* something you can do and expect the 
system to be stable.

The only case we can do that is when we attach a JTAG debugger in an AMD 
lab.

Christian.
