So, is there any progress on this issue? I do understand it's not a high
priority one, and today I've checked it on 6.0 kernel, and
unfortunately, it still persists...

I'm considering writing a patch that will allow user to override
need_dma32/dma_bits setting with a module parameter. I'll have some time
after the New Year for that.

Is it at all possible that such a patch will be merged into kernel?
