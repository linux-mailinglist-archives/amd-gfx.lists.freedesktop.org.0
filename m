> > surprising VC table:

I think this shouldn't happen. Please refer to the figure 2-98 of DP spec 1=
.4.
The payload id table should be changed to below I think.

        |1 1 1 2 3 3 X X|

I skimmed over a bit of the implementation in drm. I think it should work f=
ine
except that we have to revise function drm_dp_init_vcpi() a bit.
Since increasing/decreasing time slots should still use the same payload id=
,
we should add logic to skip trying to assign a new payload id under this ca=
se.
