Hello Ritesh,

This fix needs to be re-worked. My design was to have both 
"dma_ops_bypass" and bus_dma_limit set in case of pre-mapped TCEs.

There were a lot of things to consider - a major one was "max_pfn". This 
is not just reflective of "max memory". max_pfn changes when a GPU 
memory is added, or when pmemory is converted to RAM with a DLPAR event. 
This results in max_pfn to be much higher value than the actual RAM.

This throws off dma_direct_get_required_mask().

It will be better to revert this patch and re-work.

Thanks,

Gaurav
