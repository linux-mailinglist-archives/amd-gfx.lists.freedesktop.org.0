I think that the conclusion is everything I attempted to add relating to 
TTM_PL_PREFERRED does not really work as I initially thought it did. 
Therefore please imagine this series as only containing patches 1, 2 and 5.

(And FWIW it was quite annoying to get to the bottom of since for some 
reason the system exibits some sort of a latching behaviour, where on 
some boots and/or some minutes of runtime things were fine, and then it 
would latch onto a mode where the TTM_PL_PREFERRED induced breakage 
would show. And sometimes this breakage would appear straight away. Odd.)

I still need to test though if the subset of patches manage to achieve 
some positive improvement on their own. It is possible, as patch 5 marks 
more buffers for re-validation so once overcommit subsides they would 
get promoted to preferred placement straight away. And 1&2 are 
notionally fixes for migration throttling so at least in broad sense 
should be still valid as discussion points.

Tvrtko
