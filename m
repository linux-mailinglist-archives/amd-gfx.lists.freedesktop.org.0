I think we tried that at some point in the past but users complained
that it added latency or artifacts on the display at shutdown or
reboot time.

> Would it make sense to reset your device unconditionally on driver add?

Pretty much the same issue there.  It adds latency and you get
artifacts on the display when the reset happens.

See this block of code in amdgpu_device.c:
        /* check if we need to reset the asic
         *  E.g., driver was not cleanly unloaded previously, etc.
         */
    if (!amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev) && amdgpu_asic_need_reset_on_init(adev)) {
        r = amdgpu_asic_reset(adev);
                if (r) {
                        dev_err(adev->dev, "asic reset on init failed\n");
                        goto failed;
                }
        }

You'll want to see if amdgpu_asic_need_reset_on_init() was able to
determine that the asic needs a reset.  If it does,
amdgpu_asic_reset() getds called to reset it.
The tricky thing is that some reset methods require a fair amount of
driver state and so, they are only possible when the driver is up and
running.  Those methods are not necessarily available at driver load
time because we need to reset the GPU before we can initialize it and
determine that state so we end up in a kind of catch 22.
Unfortunately, generic PCI resets don't necessarily work on many of
our GPUs so that's not an option either.
