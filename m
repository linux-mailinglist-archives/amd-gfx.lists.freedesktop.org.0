That would be great. Right now the vkQueueSubmit for a hanging 
application ends up going through as the Wayland commit has been made, 
and the fence gets signalled.

This means we can get an image that is complete garbage from a hung app 
-- no DCC retile occured for it, which is pretty funny as the scanout 
image looks garbage, but it displays whatever it last was in composite. xD

Getting the fence error on the compositor side would be great to 
disregard such images.

We could also do more useful device loss handling with that on the 
driver side.

Thanks!
