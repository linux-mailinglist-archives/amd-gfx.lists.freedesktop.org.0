In the future, it’d be great if instead of top-posting you used 
interleaved style.

Looking at the output of `dmesg` might also help.

As switching the Linux kernel version works, you need to look at the 
driver in the Linux kernel. As you can easily reproduce your problem, 
and you are most likely alone with this old hardware, bisecting will 
probably the way to go. First you can try the packages from Ubuntu’s 
Kernel PPA [1]. Figuring out, in what version the regression occurs, you 
then build the Linux kernel yourself, for example with `make 
bindeb-pkg`, and try to find out the exact commit. There should be some 
guides on the WWW explaining all this in detail.


Kind regards and good luck,

Paul


PS: It would also be nice to know, if the problem is still present in 
Linux 5.17.
