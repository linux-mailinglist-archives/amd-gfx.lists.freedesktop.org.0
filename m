Ok.

Yes, I'm worried too that it might break other platforms, so that
option is of the table then.

Ok, the acpi_video.c code already has the option to suppress
key-press reporting based on either a cmdline option, or
a DMI quirk and the reporter of the issue has already confirmed that
the kernel cmdline option works around this. So I will submit a patch
for acpi_video.c to add a DMI quirk for this then. This seems more
of a workaround then a real solution, but it looks like this is
the best which we can do atm.

Hans
