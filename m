OK. It's no skin off my teeth and we can drop this patch if you're
convinced it's not needed. From the point of view of someone who has
no experience with this driver it seems weird to me that it would use
drm_atomic_helper_suspend() at shutdown time instead of the documented
drm_atomic_helper_shutdown(), but if it works for everyone then I'm
not gonna complain.
