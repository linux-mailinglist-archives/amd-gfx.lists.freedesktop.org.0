AER can log many different kinds of errors, some related to hardware
issues and some related to software.

PCI writes are normally posted and get no response, so AER is the main
way to find out about writes to unimplemented addresses.

Reads do get a response, of course, and reads to unimplemented
addresses cause errors that most hardware turns into a ~0 data return
(in addition to reporting via AER if enabled).
