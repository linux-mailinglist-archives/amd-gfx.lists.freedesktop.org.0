To elaborate on this a bit more, each HW plane's scanout engine
has the ability to scan out a cursor, in addition to the plane's
framebuffer. This cursor is drawn onto the plane at the scanout
phase. Any further scaling, color processing, or other operation
on the pipe will equally apply to the cursor as to the framebuffer
itself.

Our driver will look at the cursor position and place the cursor
with the topmost HW plane at that position.

We can still enable the cursor if the primary plane and overlay have a matching scale and color management - our display hardware can draw the cursor on multiple pipes.

If I understood Simon right the primary plane (bottom-most,
game plane) might not cover the entire screen, which is fine.

Is the Steam overlay always the size of the crtc, or does it
match the size of the game plane, or is it unrelated to either?

If the overlay is covering the entire screen and always active
you should be good. If the overlay appears and disappears the
cursor drawing would switch between the overlay and the game
plane.

MMHUBBUB > DCHUBBUB > HUBP (for each pipe)

MMHUBBUB is irrelevant if DWB (display writeback) is not used. DWB is not
enabled in the driver.

DCHUBBUB is the overall scanout engine for all DC pipes and includes a
HUBP per pipe.

HUBP will have requestors for the primary framebuffer, DCC meta, dynamic
metadata (for things like Dolby HDR, though it's not fully implemented),
and cursor data.
