Some good news: I actually came up with a way of handling this in the new MST
code pretty nicely, so I think we should be able to move forward without
having to disable this (although it would be very nice to know whether or not
this is necessary for amdgpu to work, since it'd still be nice to split this
into separate changes to make reviewing my big MST patch series easier. More
comments down below:

Sorry for being a bit vague with this! I typed this email at the end of
the workday and didn't feel like going super into detail on this. So I
guess I'll do that now (hopefully I didn't misread the MST spec
somewhere):

For reference: the issue I was mentioning here was regarding the fact
that the current payload management code we have doesn't keep track of
exactly which VC slots are in use by a payload at any given time - only
the starting slots and total slot counts of each payload. Which means
that once we increase a MST payload, since the additional VC slots will
be put at the end of the VC table regardless of the start of the
payload. As such, it's possible that said payload will no longer be
contiguous. An example, note for simplicity sake this example pretends
we only have 8 VC slots instead of 64:

Payloads: #1 == 2 slots, #2 == 1 slot, #3 == 2 slots

VC table looks like this, where each number corresponds to a VCPI and
X means unused:

        |1 1 2 3 3 X X X|

We decide we need to increase payload #1 from 2 slots to 3. The MST spec
mandates that new slots always are added to the end, so we end up with
this surprising VC table:

        |1 1 2 3 3 1 X X|

Now, let's say we increase payload #2 to 2 slots:

        |1 1 2 3 3 1 2 X|

Surprise - the monitor for payload #1 was unplugged, so we need to
remove it's payload. Note the MST spec doesn't allow holes between
allocations, and makes branches repsonsible for automatically moving
payloads to fill in the gaps which we have to keep track of locally.
Normally the handling of holes would be fine, as our current payload
management code loops through each payload to fill in any holes. But
these payloads aren't contiguous and we only kept track of their start
slots and total slot counts. So we would end up thinking we now have a
VC table like this:

        |2 2 3 3 X X X X|

But that's wrong, in reality the table will look like this on the MST
hub:

        |2 3 3 2 X X X X|

Now things are broken, because we now have the wrong start slot for
payload #3.

Just figured I'd clarify :). if anyone is curious, I ended up fixing
this by adding a bitmask of assigned VC slots to our atomic payload
struct - and using that to keep track of the current start slots for
each payload. Since we have a max of 64 VC slots which fits into a u64,
this works rather elegantly!
