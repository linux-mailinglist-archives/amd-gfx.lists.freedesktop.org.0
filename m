Hi Monk,

> The memory we are talking about is pure guest system memory not FB BAR right?

No, that works a bit differently.

QEMU and their virtual drivers uses a virtual PCI MMIO BAR to map 
buffers from the host into the guest. Those buffers can be both point to 
the FB BAR as well as system memory.

Only the host knows if the buffer is backed by MMIO (FB) or system 
memory, so only the host can setup the tables to have the correct 
caching and WC attributes.

The KVM patch completely breaks that because they suddenly say that not 
the host setups the caching and WC attributes but the guest.

Because of that this KVM patch not only breaks amdgpu, but also other 
drivers which do the same thing. The general approach of the patch seems 
to be broken.

We should probably move that into 
write_kernel_doorbell()/write_kernel_doorbell64() but in general looks 
correct to me as well.

Christian.
