Marek and I have been working on this quite extensively.

Long story short: No, but that's a bit more complicated to explain.

First of all the fw makes sure that processes can only be evicted after 
they used up their time slice. So when you have two processes fighting 
over a shared resource (can be memory, locks or whatever) they will 
always get until the end of their time slice before they are pushed away 
from the hw.

Then when a process is evicted we take a look at what the process has 
already scheduled as work on the hw. If the process isn't idle we start 
a delayed work item to get it going again (similar to what the KFD is 
doing at the moment). When the process is idle we unmap the doorbell 
page(s) from the CPU and wait for the page fault which signals that the 
process wants to submit something again.

And the last component is a static resource management which distributes 
the available resources equally between the different active processes 
fighting over them. Activity of a process is determined by the periodic 
interrupts send by the hw for running processes.

I call the memory management algorithm based on this Robin Hood 
(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vIrX37c3B2IgWFtZ2UpeKxh0-YMlV6NU/view) 
and simulated that a bit in some spread sheets, but it isn't fully 
implemented yet. I'm working on this for a couple of years now and 
slowly pushing DRM/TTM into the direction we need for this to work.
