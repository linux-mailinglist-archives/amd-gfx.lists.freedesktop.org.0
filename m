I'm not talking about the maximum value of the property itself either.

The value of the "max bpc" property, which can be modified by user space, defines the upper limit for the effective bpc used by the driver.

What I mean is that the "max bpc" property isn't useful for the purpose of "request a certain bpc". It only affects the upper limit, not the effective value, which can legitimately be lower. Logging a message in that case may be a false positive which may result in a spurious issue report.
