Yup, of course, all that is understood.

But we have this "no regressions" rule for a reason. Adhering to it
strictly would afaics be counter-productive in this situation, but give
users some way to manually do what was possible before out-of-the box
IMHO is the minimum we should do.

Maybe just allow that parameter only up to a certain recent GPU
generation, that way you won't have to deal with that at some point in
the future.

Taint the kernel when that module parameter is used? We iirc have a
taint bit exactly for this sort of situation. Sure, such reports will
still happen, but then you at least have an indicator to spot them.
