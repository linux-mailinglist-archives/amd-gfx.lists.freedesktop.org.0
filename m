He is my proposal:

On boot, read chip values into min_cap, default_cap, max_cap and set 
them, satisfying AMD's requirement.

Do not introduce any new boot flags, keeping things simple.

Keep def_cap and max_cap readonly to protect HW.

Make min_cap readwrite: "echo 1234 > /sys/...min_cap".

No limitation to specific HW, just general.

This way you did your job fulfilling AMD's request. If user change min, 
it was his intention anyway - HW is safe with this option. You won't see 
any false bug reports because this does not introduce instability, 
unlike OC.

As a side note, it seems Windows does not allow lower than vendors min 
as well, even via Afterburner. This may seem like "you see, they too 
follow specs", but I see it more positive for Linux. We already have a 
mesa which is on par, if not better than Nvidia driver. It is generally 
known that AMD is great on Linux. Now if on top of that Windows users 
find that not only can they get better, limitless drivers, but also 
significant - out of charts efficiency and power savings, this make 
Linux only more attractive to Windows users and make an adoption faster.
