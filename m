Well, that's not correct. You are still mixing two things up here:

1. The memory accesses from the device to the system memory must be 
coherent with the CPU cache. E.g. we root complex must snoop the CPU cache.
     That's a requirement of the PCIe spec. If you don't get that right 
a whole bunch of PCIe devices won't work correctly.

2. The memory accesses from the CPU to the devices PCIe BAR can be 
unaligned. E.g. a 64bit read can be aligned on a 32bit address.
     That is a requirement of the graphics stack. Other devices still 
might work fine without that.

Christian.
