Hi all,

As some of you have noticed, there's a TON of failure messages being
sent out for AMD gpu driver commits that are tagged for stable
backports.  In short, you all are doing something really wrong with how
you are tagging these.

Please fix it up to NOT have duplicates in multiple branches that end up
in Linus's tree at different times.  Or if you MUST do that, then give
us a chance to figure out that it IS a duplicate.  As-is, it's not
working at all, and I think I need to just drop all patches for this
driver that are tagged for stable going forward and rely on you all to
provide a proper set of backported fixes when you say they are needed.

Again, what you are doing today is NOT ok and is broken.  Please fix.

greg k-h
