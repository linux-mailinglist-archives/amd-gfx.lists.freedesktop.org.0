Hey,

I have nearly finished my patch, I need to double check some stuff
first but here is a summary of the real cause that I can see.
See below for a in depth in depth analysis. I am not sure technically
if thunderbolt is at fault in this scenario or the amdgpu please let
me know what your opinion is on this and where it should be patched
at. Of course the patch i'm working on allows for a resolution path if
it happens which is a nice recovery mode but it doesnt solve it
occuring.

## Summary

R9700 Pro [1002:7551] (gfx1201) connected via Thunderbolt 5 dock. GPU
initializes fully but MMIO becomes unreachable while PCIe config space
continues to work. MMIO becomes unresponsive,
cascading into SDMA timeouts and GPU reset loops. Reproduced on two
separate boots (10s and 96s after init).

The split between working config space and dead MMIO points to the
Thunderbolt PCIe tunnel selectively dropping memory transactions while
continuing to pass configuration transactions.

## Hardware

- Host: MSI MS-S1 MAX (Strix Halo), AMD IOMMU
- Thunderbolt host controller: Intel Barlow Ridge TB5 [8086:5780] at 67:00.=
0
- Dock: Razer Core X V2 (TB4, FW 59.82)
- GPU: AMD R9700 Pro [1002:7551] gfx1201, 32GB GDDR6
- Connection: TB5 host =E2=86=92 TB4 dock, 40 Gb/s dual lane
- TB tunnel: PCIe 0:10 <-> 3:9, extended encapsulation enabled
- PCIe topology through dock:
```
66:03.0 TB bridge (32GB pref window)
93:00.0 Intel 5786 Upstream Switch
94:00.0 Intel 5786 Downstream Switch (Gen4 x4 to AMD switch)
95:00.0 AMD 1478 Upstream Switch
96:00.0 AMD 1479 Downstream Switch (Gen5 x16 to GPU)
97:00.0 GPU [1002:7551]
```
- No display connected to eGPU

## Kernel

```
Linux 7.0.0-rc7-egpu+ #7 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC
cmdline: pcie_port_pm=3Doff pcie_aspm=3Doff amdgpu.runpm=3D0
```

## The evidence

### 1. GPU initializes successfully on both boots

Boot -1 (7.0.0-rc7-egpu+, journalctl, precise timestamps):
```
16:45:46.038 SMU is initialized successfully!
16:45:46.038 [drm] Display Core v3.2.369 initialized on DCN 4.0.1
16:45:46.131 runtime pm is manually disabled
16:45:46.131 [drm] Initialized amdgpu 3.64.0 for 0000:97:00.0 on minor 0
```

Boot 0 (7.0.0-rc7-egpu+, dmesg):
```
[9551.162] SMU is initialized successfully!
[9551.163] [drm] Display Core v3.2.369 initialized on DCN 4.0.1
[9551.248] runtime pm is manually disabled
[9551.249] [drm] Initialized amdgpu 3.64.0 for 0000:97:00.0 on minor 0
```

All IP blocks come up clean. 32624MB VRAM. 64 CUs. SMU responds to
all init-time messages. No errors during initialization.

### 2. SMU becomes unreachable after variable delay

Boot -1 =E2=80=94 **10 seconds** after init:
```
16:45:56.192 Failed to disable gfxoff!
16:45:56.192 SMU is in hanged state, failed to send smu message!
16:45:56.192 Failed to export SMU metrics table!
(repeated ~30 times)
```

Boot 0 =E2=80=94 **96 seconds** after init:
```
[9647.872] Failed to export SMU metrics table!
[9647.872] SMU is in hanged state, failed to send smu message!
(repeated)
[9661.567] Failed to disable gfxoff!
```

The delay is not consistent (10s vs 96s), ruling out a fixed firmware
timer. The first failing operation varies (gfxoff disable vs metrics
export), suggesting the SMU itself isn't crashing =E2=80=94 the communicati=
on
path to it is dying.

### 3. Config space alive, MMIO dead (proved during boot 0 crash)

Tested during the active crash with the GPU in "SMU hanged" state:

**Config space (works):**
```
$ sudo setpci -s 97:00.0 0x00.l
75511002 =E2=86=90 correct vendor/device ID
$ sudo setpci -s 97:00.0 0x04.l
00100406 =E2=86=90 status/command register OK
```

**MMIO BAR5 at 0xc4000000 =E2=80=94 SMU register space (dead):**
```python
fd =3D os.open('/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:97:00.0/resource5', os.O_RDONLY)
data =3D os.read(fd, 4)
# OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error
```

**MMIO BAR0 at 0x8880000000 =E2=80=94 VRAM (dead):**
```python
fd =3D os.open('/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:97:00.0/resource0', os.O_RDONLY)
data =3D os.read(fd, 4)
# OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error
```

Config transactions reach the device through the TB tunnel. Memory
transactions do not. This is the root cause of the "SMU hanged state" =E2=
=80=94
the SMU firmware is likely fine, but the MMIO writes to its mailbox
registers never arrive.

### 4. Thunderbolt host router and dock are runtime-suspended

Monitored with 2-second polling during the crash:
```
16:54:06 host=3Dsuspended dock=3Dsuspended gpu_errors=3D1
16:54:09 host=3Dsuspended dock=3Dsuspended gpu_errors=3D3
16:54:11 host=3Dsuspended dock=3Dsuspended gpu_errors=3D5
...
16:54:57 host=3Dsuspended dock=3Dsuspended gpu_errors=3D119
```

TB host router runtime PM configuration:
```
/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/power/control =3D auto
/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/power/autosuspend_delay_ms =3D 15000
/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/power/runtime_status =3D suspended
```

Both the TB host router and dock switch show `suspended` throughout
the crash. The PCIe tunnel was activated while they were in this state.

### 5. Waking TB host router does not restore MMIO

```
$ echo "on" > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/power/control
$ cat /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/power/runtime_status
active

$ python3 -c "os.read(os.open('/sys/bus/pci/devices/.../resource5', ...), 4=
)"
# OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error =E2=86=90 still dead
```

Once MMIO is lost, waking the TB host router doesn't recover it. The
damage to the memory transaction path persists until device removal
and re-enumeration (or reboot).

### 6. Full crash cascade (boot -1)

```
16:45:46 Init complete
16:45:56 SMU hanged (MMIO path dead)
16:45:58 SDMA ring timeout =E2=86=92 ring reset succeeds
16:46:00 SDMA ring timeout again =E2=86=92 ring reset succeeds
16:51:16 Full GPU reset (MODE1 via SMU)
16:51:33 GPU reset succeeded, SMU resumed
GPU runs for 37 more minutes
17:28:17 SDMA timeout =E2=86=92 ring reset FAILS
17:28:17 GPU reset returns -ENODEV (device gone from bus)
Infinite reset loop, system unusable
```

MODE1 reset succeeds once (re-establishing the MMIO path temporarily)
but the problem recurs, and the second MODE1 reset kills the PCIe link
entirely (-ENODEV).

## Configuration notes

- `amdgpu.runpm=3D0` is set and confirmed. GPU runtime PM (BOCO) is not
active. This does not prevent the crash.
- `pcie_port_pm=3Doff pcie_aspm=3Doff` are set. PCIe link power management
is disabled. This does not prevent the crash.
- TB host router runtime PM (`power/control=3Dauto`) is NOT disabled by
any of the above kernel parameters.
- SMU FW version mismatch: driver expects interface 0x2e, FW reports 0x32.
Init succeeds despite mismatch.
- "PCIE atomic ops is not supported" =E2=80=94 TB bridge doesn't support At=
omicOps.
