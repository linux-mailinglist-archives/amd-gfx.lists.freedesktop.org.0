Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker again. Top-posting once
more, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

What's the status of this? It looks stuck, or did the discussion
continue somewhere else? James, it sounded like you wanted to test
something, did you give it a try? Or is there some reason why I should
stop tracking this regression?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
