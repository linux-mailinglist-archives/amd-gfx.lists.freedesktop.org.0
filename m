OK, here it is:

I tried everything stock first, and that causes the crash more than the newer 
kernel, with more serious memory ring corruption sorts of errors.

The messages from the newer kernels are tamer and less frequent, but still 
present.

I see some directions about disabling the PSR using some sysfs controls. Is 
there a more reliable way of disabling it with a boot flag or something that's 
more... guaranteed to intercept it and shut it off before any display managers 
launch? Here is what I am currently seeing, let me know what else I can dump 
out...

# find /sys/kernel/debug | fgrep -i psr | sort
/sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/eDP-1/psr_capability
/sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/eDP-1/psr_residency

How new? Or what branch or sub-branch? I have compiled plenty of them back 
when Linux used to need it more often in the 90s. So I will gladly run 
whatever you want and get logs or whatever.

Thanks again for your assistance.

Matthew.
