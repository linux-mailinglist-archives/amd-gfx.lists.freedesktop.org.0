So far we have implemented the GPU reset and soft reset, but we
haven't done anything to have a robust system recovery. Under the
current system, things can easily keep hanging indefinitely because
nothing prevents that.

The reset status query should stay. Robust apps will use it to tell
when they should recreate their context and resources even if they
don't submit anything. Let's fully trust robust apps here. In the
future we might change our mind about that, but for now, let's just
focus on API conformance, and later we can change it as long as we
stay API conformant.

Non-robust apps must be terminated when they hang or are innocent but
affected. Their existence is a security and usability problem and a
source of frustrations for users. 100% guaranteed system recovery is
impossible if they continue to live.

IBs should be rejected for all guilty and affected innocent contexts
unconditionally, both robust and non-robust ones, by the kernel.
Userspace only forwards the reset status to apps for robust contexts
and doesn't do anything else, but userspace may decide to terminate
the process if any non-robust context is affected.
