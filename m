So the patches end up in -next and if they are important for stable, they go to -fixes too.  We don't want -next to be broken, but we can't wait until the next kernel cycle to get the bug fixes into the current kernel and stable.  I don't know of a good way to make this smoother.

Thanks Alex, seems quite complicated indeed.

So, let me check if I understood properly: there are 2 trees (-fixes and
-next), and the problem is that their merge onto mainline happens apart
and there are kind of duplicate commits, that were first merged on
-fixes, then "re-merged" on -next, right?

Would be possible to clean the -next tree right before the merge, using
some script to find commits there that are going to be merged but are
already present? Then you'd have a -next-to-merge tree that is clean and
doesn't present dups, avoiding this.

Disclaimer: I'm not a maintainer, maybe there are smart ways of doing
that or perhaps my suggestion is silly and unfeasible heh
But seems likely that other maintainers face this problem as well and
came up with some solution - avoiding the dups would be a good thing,
IMO, if possible.

Cheers,


Guilherme
