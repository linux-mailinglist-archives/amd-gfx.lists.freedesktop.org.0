Not sure whether this one here is due to my input, but s/UMD/KMD. Repeat
offender killing is more a policy where the kernel enforces policy, and no
longer up to userspace to dtrt (because very clearly userspace is not
really doing the right thing anymore when it's just hanging the gpu in an
endless loop). Also maybe tune it down further to something like "the
kernel driver may implemnent ..."

In my opinion the umd shouldn't implement these kind of magic guesses, the
entire point of robustness apis is to delegate responsibility for
correctly recovering to the application. And the kernel is left with
enforcing fair resource usage policies (which eventually might be a
cgroups limit on how much gpu time you're allowed to waste with gpu
resets).

Since we do not seem to have a solid consensus in the community about
non-robust userspace, maybe we could just document that lack of consensus
to unblock this patch? Something like this:

Non-Robust Userspace
--------------------

Userspace that doesn't support robust interfaces (like an non-robust
OpenGL context or API without any robustness support like libva) leave the
robustness handling entirely to the userspace driver. There is no strong
community consensus on what the userspace driver should do in that case,
since all reasonable approaches have some clear downsides.

With the s/UMD/KMD/ further up and maybe something added to record the
non-robustness non-consensus:
