This is exactly the comment that shouldn't have been sent, and you are
not the only one.

Nobody should ever care about subjective experiences. We can only do
this properly by looking at the whole system and its rules and try to
find a solution that works for everything on paper first. DrawIndirect
is one case where the current system fails. "Works for me because I
don't use DrawIndirect" is a horrible way to do this.
