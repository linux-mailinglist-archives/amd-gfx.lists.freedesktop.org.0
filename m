That's not what I meant. I thought the rule is that the shared fences
_together_ need to signal after the exclusive ones. Not each individual
one.

This means that if you have both exclusive  fences and shared fences, and
you want to wait for just the shared fences, then you can ignore the
exclusive ones.

You have a patch series floating around which "fixes" this, but I think
it's imcomplete. And I'm pretty sure it's a change of defacto rules, since
not obeying this breaks a bunch of existing code (as you've noticed).
