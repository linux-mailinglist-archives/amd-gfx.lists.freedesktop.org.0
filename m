Hi Christian,
	Thanks for the information. Previously I assume that we may =
reset the asic and reload all firmwares on resume, but missed the vcn ip =
block which save and restore firmware vram content during =
suspend/resume. Is there any other IP blocks which save and restore =
firmware ram content?
	Our usage scenario targets GPGPU workload (amdkfd) with AMD GPU =
in single SR-IOV vGPU mode. Is it possible to resume on a different vGPU =
device in such a case?
Regards,
Gerry=20
