That seems odd to me it would advertise a higher link speed than it 
could train at.

I mean that's essentially what happens when 
amdgpu_device_pcie_dynamic_switching_supported() returns that it doesn't 
work.

If your theory is right; maybe what we really need is a pile of DMI 
quirks for M/B that are having this problem.
