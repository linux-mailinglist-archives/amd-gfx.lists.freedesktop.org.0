Let me recap what happened here:

1. AMD is the GPU manufacturer, but apart from a few exceptions doesn't 
assemble boards.

2. Vendors take AMDs GPUs and assemble them together with power 
regulators, memory and a bunch of other components into PCIe board.

3. AMD provides a vendor agnostic driver and for this to work vendors 
describe to the min/max voltage their power regulators can do in some 
flash memory.

4. Hardware engineers point out that AMDs open source drivers are not 
respecting the min value.

5. In response a patch was applied to respect that value and not use 
something outside of the hardware specification the vendor provided.

I'm not sure about it but I think AMD need to respect the min/max values 
simply by contract and it's not really an option to not do that.

If someone really want to run your hardware outside the vendor 
recommended values that person can still patch the driver to ignore the 
limits. It's just that then AMD is not responsible for any damage 
resulting from that.

So as far as I can see the request to make that a module option is a 
no-go, especially since hardware engineers have explicitly pointed out 
that we have to do this in the software stack.

Regards,
Christian.
