Those are 4k by default on modern systems as well and while over allocating them to 64k is possible that not only wastes some VRAM but can also result in OOM situations because we can't allocate the necessary page tables to switch from 2MiB to 4k pages in some cases.

To map a single CPU page to the GPU, we therefore need to create multiple GPU page table entries for that CPU page.

Background is that you sometimes need to split up higher order pages (1G, 2M) into lower order pages (2M, 4k) to be able to swap things to system memory for example and for that you need some an extra layer of page tables.

Yes and no. It's mostly the normal BO based swapping of TTM. SVM is still an experimental and extremely rarely used feature.

Correct, yes.

See AMDGPU_VM_RESERVED_VRAM.

>>>>>>>> Well this is generally nice to have, but there are unfortunately some HW limitations which makes ROCm pretty much unusable on non 4k page size systems.
>>>>>>> That's a bummer :(
>>>>>>> - Do we have some HW documentation around what are these limitations around non-4K pagesize? Any links to such please?
>>>>>> You already mentioned MMIO remap which obviously has that problem, but if I'm not completely mistaken the PCIe doorbell BAR and some global seq counter resources will also cause problems here.
>>>>>>
>>>>>> This can all be worked around by delegating those MMIO accesses into the kernel, but that means tons of extra IOCTL overhead.
>>>>>>
>>>>>> Especially the cache flushes which are necessary to avoid corruption are really bad for performance in such an approach.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>> - Are there any latest AMD GPU versions which maybe lifts such restrictions?
>>>>>> Not that I know off any.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>> What we can do is to support graphics and MM, but that should already work out of the box.
>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> - Maybe we should also document, what will work and what won't work due to these HW limitations.
>>>>>> Well pretty much everything, I need to double check how ROCm does HDP flushing/invalidating when the MMIO remap isn't available.
>>>>>>
>>>>>> Could be that there is already a fallback path and that's the reason why this approach actually works at all.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>> What we can do is to support graphics and MM, but that should already work out of the box.>
>>>>>>> So these patches helped us resolve most of the issues like SDMA hangs
>>>>>>> and GPU kernel page faults which we saw with rocr and rccl tests with
>>>>>>> 64K pagesize. Meaning, we didn't see this working out of box perhaps
>>>>>>> due to 64K pagesize.
>>>>>> Yeah, but this is all for ROCm and not the graphics side.
>>>>>>
>>>>>> To be honest I'm not sure how ROCm even works when you have 64k pages at the moment. I would expect much more issue lurking in the kernel driver.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>> AFAIU, some of these patches may require re-work based on reviews, but
>>>>>>> at least with these changes, we were able to see all the tests passing.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>> I need to talk with Alex and the ROCm team about it if workarounds can be implemented for those issues.
>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> Thanks a lot! That would be super helpful!

>>>>>> You are welcome, but since it's so near to the end of the year not all people are available any more.
