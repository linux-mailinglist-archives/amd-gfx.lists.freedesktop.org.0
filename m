drm_dev_get/put in drm_prime helpers should get us like 90% there I think.

The even more worrying thing is random dma_fence attached to the dma_resv
object. We could try to clean all of ours up, but they could have escaped
already into some other driver. And since we're talking about egpu
hotunplug, dma_fence escaping to the igpu is a pretty reasonable use-case.

I have no how to fix that one :-/
