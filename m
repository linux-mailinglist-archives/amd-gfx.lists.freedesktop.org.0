I fail to see a convincing explanation on how DSC degrades user experience.
No video or anything. It's somewhat difficult to judge the merit of a
ticket like that.

I agree with this goal. First, reasonable defaults. Secondly, inform
userspace, thirdly, let userspace set different configs. In that order.
To get #2 and #3 right we need the conversation that Michel started.
