Right.  For gfx, compute, and SDMA you have pipes (called instances on
SDMA) and queues.  A pipe can only execute one queue at a time.  The
pipe will switch between all of the mapped queues.  You have storage
in memory (called an MDQ -- Memory Queue Descriptor) which defines the
state of the queue (GPU virtual addresses of the queue itself, save
areas, doorbell, etc.).  The queues that the pipe switches between are
defined by HQDs (Hardware Queue Descriptors).  These are basically
register based memory for the queues that the pipe can switch between.
The driver sets up an MQD for each queue that it creates.  The MQDs
are then handed to the MES firmware for mapping.  The MES firmware can
map a queue as a legacy queue (i.e. a kernel queue) or a user queue.
The difference is that a legacy queue is statically mapped to a HQD
and is never preempted.  User queues are dynamically mapped to the
HQDs by the MES firmware.  If there are more MQDs than HQDs, the MES
firmware will preempt other user queues to make sure each queue gets a
time slice.

More or less.  The MES handles all of the queues (kernel or user).
The only real difference is that kernel queues are statically mapped
to an HQD while user queues are dynamically scheduled in the available
HQDs based on level of over-subscription.  E.g., if you have hardware
with 1 pipe and 2 HQDs you could have a kernel queue on 1 HQD and the
MES would schedule all of the user queues on the remaining 1 HQD.  If
you don't enable any kernel queues, then you have 2 HQDs that the MES
can use for scheduling user queues.

Right.  This series paves the way for getting rid of kernel queues all
together.  Having no kernel queues leaves all of the resources
available to user queues.

In the future of user queues, kernel queues would not be created or
used at all.  Today, on most existing hardware, kernel queues are all
that is available.  Today, when an application submits work to the
kernel driver, the kernel driver submits all of the application
command buffers to kernel queues.  E.g., in most cases there is a
single kernel GFX queue and all applications which want to use the GFX
engine funnel into that queue.  The CS IOCTL basically takes the
command buffers from the applications and schedules them on the kernel
queue.  With user queues, each application will create its own user
queues and will submit work directly to its user queues.  No need for
an IOCTL for each submission, no need to share a single kernel queue,
etc.
