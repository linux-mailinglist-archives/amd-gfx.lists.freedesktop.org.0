Well, this limitation only applies to Raven which is an integrated GPU
in client parts.  SME was initially productized on server parts so
there was not a lot of concern given to interactions with integrated
graphics at the time.  This has since been fixed in newer integrated
graphics.  dGPUs work fine as long as the IOMMU is in remapping mode
to handle the C bit.

From the x86 model and family info?  I think Raven has different
families from other Zen based CPUs.

Right.

@Tom Lendacky Any ideas?
