I think the problem here is that no one even tried to make a
real userspace implementation. So it's very hard to judge if this
new property is actually usable in the end, or if it will just end
up as historical baggage that we have to carry around forever.

IMO just having userspace log what the kernel said does not fulfill
the "userspace implementation must be ready before new drm uapi is
merged" requirement.
