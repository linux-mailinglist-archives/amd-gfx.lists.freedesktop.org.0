I think this is too strict? At least I could come up with other scenarios
where we'd need a new linear variant:
- one driver, but two different devices that happen to have incompatible
  linear requirements which break and get fixed with the new linear mode.
- one driver, one device, but non-driver userspace allocates the linear
  buffer somewhere else (e.g. from dma-buf heaps) and gets pitch
  constraints wrong

This also feels a bit too strict, since I think what Daniel proposed is
that drivers do the special LINEAR handling when there are variants
present in the list of compatible modifiers for an alloation. Hence I
don't think compositor patches are necessarily required, but we definitely
need to test to make sure it actually works and there's not surprises.

The exception is of course when non-mesa userspace allocates/sizes the
buffer itself (maybe for an soc where the display is separate and the gpu
has stricter stride constraints than the display).

I think that's really the crucial part, because adding modifiers without
an actual use-case that they fix is just asking for more future trouble I
think.
