Can you elaborate on this?  In the universe of drivers, very few do
their own ASPM configuration, and it's usually to work around hardware
defects, e.g., L1 doesn't work on some e1000e devices, L0s doesn't
work on some iwlwifi devices, etc.

The core does know how to configure all the ASPM features defined in
the PCIe spec, e.g., L0s, L1, L1.1, L1.2, and LTR.

I think it's clearly the intent of the PCIe spec that ASPM
configuration be done by generic code.  Here are some things that
require a system-level view, not just an individual device view:

  - L0s, L1, and L1 Substates cannot be enabled unless both ends
    support it (PCIe r6.0, secs 5.4.1.4, 7.5.3.7, 5.5.4).

  - Devices advertise the "Acceptable Latency" they can accept for
    transitions from L0s or L1 to L0, and the actual latency depends
    on the "Exit Latencies" of all the devices in the path to the Root
    Port (sec 5.4.1.3.2).

  - LTR (required by L1.2) cannot be enabled unless it is already
    enabled in all upstream devices (sec 6.18).  This patch relies on
    "ltr_path", which works now but relies on the PCI core never
    reconfiguring the upstream path.

There might be amdgpu-specific features the driver needs to set up,
but if drivers fiddle with architected features like LTR behind the
PCI core's back, things are likely to break.

If the PCI core has stability issues, I want to fix them.  This
hardware may have its own stability issues, and I would ideally like
to have drivers use interfaces like pci_disable_link_state() to avoid
broken things.  Maybe we need new interfaces for more subtle kinds of
breakage.
