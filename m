No, there are other places where this is more explicit.

"If device loss occurs (see <<devsandqueues-lost-device,Lost Device>>) 
before
the timeout has expired, fname:vkWaitForFences must: return in finite time
with either ename:VK_SUCCESS or ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST."

"If device loss occurs (see <<devsandqueues-lost-device,Lost Device>>) 
before
the timeout has expired, fname:vkWaitSemaphores must: return in finite time
with either ename:VK_SUCCESS or ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST."
