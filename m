Killing apps that the kernel thinks are misbehaving really doesn't
seem like a good idea to me. What if the process is a service getting
restarted after getting killed? What if killing that process leaves
the system in a bad state?

Can't the kernel provide some information to user space so that e.g.
systemd can handle those situations?
