Thanks for the clarification.

Struct page already maintains is memcg. The one which has charged it and
it will stay constatnt throughout of the allocation lifetime (cgroup v1
has a concept of the charge migration but this hasn't been adopted in
v2).

We have a concept of active_memcg which allows to charge against a
different memcg than the allocating context. From your example above I
do not think this is really usable for the described usecase as the X is
not aware where the request comes from?

If you can enforce that the owner is really responsible for the
allocation then all should be fine. That would require MAP_POPULATE like
semantic and I suspect this is not really feasible with the existing
userspace. It would be certainly hard to enforce for bad players.
