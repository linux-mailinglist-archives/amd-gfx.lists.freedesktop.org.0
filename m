Not really.

The "max bpc" property is simply an upper limit for the effective bpc that can be used by the driver; nothing more or less. The driver is free to use any lower bpc value though, that doesn't mean anything's wrong.

It doesn't imply that the "max bpc" value can actually be achieved under any circumstances.

The practical purpose is mainly to restrict bpc in cases where higher bpc would prevent e.g. higher refresh rate.

Per above, the "max bpc" property isn't really useful for that.

I know AMD GPUs can do at least temporal dithering of the data they send over the link, I suspect non-temporal as well.

Either way, the user may be able to distinguish more information than the "link bpc" property value implies.
