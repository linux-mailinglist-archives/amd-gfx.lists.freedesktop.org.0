Yes. I'd like to ask the GPU people to look at it and say how much damage 
this -EINTR could do. I don't know - I just saw the messages "Failed to 
register MMU notifier: -4" in the syslog.

EINTR can be returned from open() in cases when it was historically 
behaving this way - such as opening a fifo when there is no matching 
process having it open.

But I think that opening /dev/kfd doesn't fall into this category.

NFS has an "intr" flag that makes the filesystem syscalls interruptible by 
signals. It is off by default, because many programs don't expect EINTR 
when opening, reading or writing plain files on a filesystem.

I use SA_RESTART for the signals. And I retry all the syscalls on EINTR 
just in case SA_RESTART didn't work. So, I don't experience random 
failures in my code due to the periodic signal.

But there is code that I have no control over - such as the OpenCL shared 
library.

So far, I worked around this issue by blocking all signals around 
clGetPlatformIDs and clGetDeviceIDs - but this is a hack.

If clGetDeviceIDs fails and I call clGetDeviceIDs again, it doesn't even 
attempt to open /dev/kfd again and fails right away. So, I can't work 
around it by retrying it.

From the process's point of view, they are random - the process doesn't 
know when the user will drag the corner of the terminal window and resize 
it. If the process spawns a subprocess, it cannot predict when will the 
subprocess exit and SIGCHLD will be delivered.

If we don't change it, we end up with unreliable software stack that can 
fail during rare events, such as dragging the corner of the window.

OK, so I'll try to rewrite the commit message and submit version 4 of the 
patch.
