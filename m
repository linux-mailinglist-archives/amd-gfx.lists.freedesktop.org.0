Chiming in here to basically agree with Daniel and underline his point with
some evidence.

This kind of encourages me to say that the meaning of "bpc" here should
either be reduced by all compression (of which I see dithering as a
primitive variant of) or left at the uncompressed bpc for all compression.

I'm leaning towards the latter. 10bpc lossily compressed to 8bpc is likely
a better choice than plain 8bpc for visual clarity, so making them look the
same to userspace would result in some odd choices. At the same time, having
a separate way for userspace to know of any compression techniques applied
on the output would disambiguate that for those compositors that really care,
and would also mean we don't have to make subjective judgement calls for
anyone.

With regards to DSC for example, any vendor's decision to enable it by
default does not necessarily give us a good precedent for what side to
err on. amdgpu flips on DSC when it doesn't have to, and this has rubbed
some people wrong: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/work_items/2043

The goal isn't so much to push driver logic into userspace, but to give
userspace a view into what the driver did, so that it can decide whether
it's happy or wants to try again differently. This means userspace isn't
ossifying on a set of parameters that made sense a decade ago; drivers can
still modify their decisions as they develop and hardware gains new
techniques.
