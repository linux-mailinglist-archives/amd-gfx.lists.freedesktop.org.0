Hi,

I agree that filtering based on timestamps is not a good idea in general, a=
nd=20
we should probably re-think it. I wish someone had thought of that in 2021=
=20
when the above patch was accepted.

Maybe this patch should be dropped and the timestamp check should be remove=
d=20
instead. What do you guys think about that?

Best regards,
Timur
