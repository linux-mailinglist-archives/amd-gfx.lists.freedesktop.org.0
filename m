Kernel Interface Queue.  This is a control queue used by the kernel
driver to manage other gfx and compute queues on the GFX/compute
engine.  You can use it to map/unmap additional queues, etc.

MicroEngine Compute.  The is the microcontroller that controls the
compute queues on the GFX/compute engine.

MicroEngine Scheduler.  This is a new engine for managing queues.
This is currently unused.

RunList Controller.  This is another microcontroller in the
GFX/Compute engine.  It handles power management related functionality
within the GFX/Compute engine.  The name is a vestige of old hardware
where it was originally added and doesn't really have much relation to
what the engine does now.

IB = Indirect Buffer.  A command buffer for a particular engine.
Rather than writing commands directly to the queue, you can write the
commands into a piece of memory and then put a pointer to the memory
into the queue.  The hardware will then follow the pointer and execute
the commands in the memory, then returning to the rest of the commands
in the ring.

SS = Spread Spectrum.

CP = Command Processor.  The name for the hardware block that
encompasses the front end of the GFX/Compute pipeline.  Consists
mainly of a bunch of microcontrollers (PFP, ME, CE, MEC).  The
firmware that runs on these microcontrollers provides the driver
interface to interact with the GFX/Compute engine.

It depends on the Engine.  Each engine has it's own packet format.
GFX/Compute uses one format, SDMA uses another, VCN uses another.
They are documented in the code and headers for the relevant engines.

It's informational so we can see what queue slot is being used for
KIQ.  There are requirements around the physical queue slot for KIQ so
it useful to know it.  That said, it could probably be made debug
only.

Not likely.  The PSP failing to load firmware is most likely the
problem.  You need to have a functional PSP for any of the other
engines to be usable.  If we can't load the firmware for the
microcontrollers, the driver can't interact with them.

Yeah, would be useful.
