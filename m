Unfortunately, further testing shows that this partial revert is
insufficient to fully fix the problem. Only a complete revert works.
This worries me a little though, because my analysis seemed correct. If
the first chunk needs to be reverted too, it means that this code path
is taken on a regular basis in my case. I would expect
pm_runtime_get_sync() failures to be an error path that should normally
not be taken?

At this point I am wondering if maybe we had 2 opposite reference
counting bugs covering for each other, and fixing one revealed the
other. Or maybe the prime issue is that pm_runtime_get_sync() shouldn't
fail in the first place, and that's what we need to fix.

I'm not familiar enough with the amdgpu driver to efficiently continue
debugging this issue on my own, so I'll do what I can, but some
guidance would be welcome.
