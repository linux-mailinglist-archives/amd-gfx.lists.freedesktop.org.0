hey blank are you seeing the device resume from runtime suspend?  On resume=
 from suspend (runtime or system) we issue a hotplug notification to usersp=
ace in case any displays changed during suspend when the GPU was powered do=
wn (and hence could not detect a hotplug event).  Perhaps that event is tri=
ggering userspace to reprobe and re-enable the displays shortly after resum=
e from runtime suspend due to some other event that caused the device to ru=
ntime resume.  Does something like this help by any chance?

I think something like this patch may do the trick:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=3D300109&action=3Ddiff&collap=
sed=3D&headers=3D1&format=3Draw
We can use the helper to check if anything actually changed.
