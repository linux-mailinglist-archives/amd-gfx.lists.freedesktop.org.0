Yeah I agree with this part, which is why in the past I didn't ask people
to keep that part, but also won't complain if it's kept. The entire goal
being "minimal amount to get to a commit message that's hopefully
complete". I think with b4 this has now also become a bit easier than 10+
years ago.

Also all the kernel fd.o lists are on lore and the archive on fd.o is
under our control, so hopefully the archive situation shouldn't ever be an
issue for us.

Anyway no strong opinion from me, but we might want to document that we're
a bit more relaxed here.

*shrugs*
