Hello,

One person on the Gitlab issue have potentially bisected the commit causing=
 the kernel freeze: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3787#no=
te_2741901

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/kernel/-/commit/de848da12f752170c2ebe114=
804a985314fd5a6a

Also I apologize Alex I think I sent you an email without cc the mailing li=
st.
