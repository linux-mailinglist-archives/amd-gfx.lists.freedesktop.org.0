I'm pretty sure it's the memory interface.  Power team said same thing
from what they can remember.

There is no BACO support in the driver for SI yet. The reset support
for SI doesn't use BACO.

You could port the existing SI dpm code to the powerplay code base
that is used by CI, but you can't reuse the CI code directly.  It
would need its own BACO sequence.  I should be able to dig that up for
you if you get to that point.

Sort of.  We've been iterating on SMU firmware interfaces since R7xx.
There are a number of differences.  We supported both SI and CI in
radeon with the same framework.  When we started amdgpu, we inherited
the radeon interface there too, but later ported CI to the powerplay
interface.  So it's doable.  You'll have to add smu6 equivalents of
smu7_hwmgr.c and smu7_smumgr.c, add powerplay table parsing, etc.  You
can reference the existing code bases in amdgpu and radeon.

The powertune stuff is already there.  For the profiles, do you mean
the PP_SMC_POWER_PROFILE_* stuff?  That was only available on SMU7.
