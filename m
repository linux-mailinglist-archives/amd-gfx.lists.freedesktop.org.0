What do you mean by used?  Do you mean plugged in to the GPU or used
in the GUI?  It might be easier to debug this without a GUI involved.
Can you try this at runlevel 3 or something equivalent for your
distro?

When the GPU is powered up, the driver gets an interrupt when a
display is hotplugged and generates an event and userspace
applications can listen for these events.  When the GPU is powered
down, there's no interrupt.  I think most GUIs poll GPUs periodically
to handle this case so they can detect a new display even when the GPU
is off.  Maybe we are getting some sort of race here.  GUI queries GPU
driver, causes GPU to wake up, checks attached displays, GPU driver
resets runtime pm timer.  GPU goes back to sleep.  The detection
updates the ELD data which causes the HDA driver to wake up.  It
assumes the hw is on and tries to query it.  In the meantime, the GPU
has already powered everything down again.
