The SDMA job is already executing at that point.  The allow gfxoff
message to the firmware shouldn't come until later because it's
handled by a delayed work thread from end_use().  If you have multiple
submissions to SDMA within the delay window, the begin_use() and
end_use() will just be ref count handling and won't actually talk to
the firmware.

Only if all of the blocks are idle which would likely not be the case
if you have outstanding jobs.
