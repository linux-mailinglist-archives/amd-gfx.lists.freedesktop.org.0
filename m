Can we add some Why? in here, like what use cases does this enable,

Some more explanation about what these hanging about fences will be
used in, like if the module is gone away, I have to assume this is for
already signalled fences, so someone is waiting and hasn't cleaned up
yet?

What problem does it solve wrt module unload, what scenario is
unloading amdgpu not possible in now, what scenario will it be able to
unload in after?

Thanks,

Dave.
