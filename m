Even if the bisect did land on this commit, it doesn't make sense. I would
think that one of the results of the bisect was incorrect (a pass that
should have failed?), as that would lead the bisect down to the wrong
conclusion.

Now if you you remove this commit and everything works fine, and add it
back again and it fails reliably, then I can't argue it is not the commit.

But the commit in question kicks off a worker thread at boot up to search
for weak functions that were tagged to be traced by the function tracer and
sets them to "disabled" to never be traced.

Is the function tracer used at all here? I really do not see how this
commit affects the code that is crashing. Unless there's something wrong
with the way the kworker was set up and it corrupted other kworkers :-/
