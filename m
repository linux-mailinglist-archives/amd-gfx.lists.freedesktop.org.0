I have tried many different of unpatched and patched 6.14.6 for a few hours and I could not get this same bug again.

After unsuccessfully attempting to reproduce with the kernel I have been running I decided to test the newest "PM_ Use hibernate flows for system power off" patch [1].

and that patch seems to help quickly poweroff my laptop when combined with the other mentioned patch.

> To confirm if "PCI: Explicitly put devices into D0 when initializing" is the cause can you compare the PCI state of all devices from sysfs with and without the patch in place after bootup?  Basically run this in patched kernel and unpatched kernel and let's compare.

unpatched: https://pastebin.com/Ym31Vjh6
patched with just "PCI: Explicitly put devices into D0 when initializing": https://pastebin.com/SSSWLgcs

diff for easy view: https://www.diffchecker.com/y5GVyEG1/


two devices were D3hot and two were unknown, while now are recognized as D0.


Having those two patches together does not seem to cause any harm and I could not reproduce the issue.

I do not believe any of those patches are the cause for the particular crash I experienced, however I do believe there is something wrong going on because on power on the amdgpu on the thunderbolt card sometimes is there sometimes is not and I have to unplug and replug it for it to work.

The only patch that alleviates this particular problem is [2] "[PATCH v3] PCI: Prevent power state transition of erroneous device" but it comes with a regression where I can no longer wake up the laptop properly.

I will write this in detail as a response to that patch given that was not part of the subject here.
