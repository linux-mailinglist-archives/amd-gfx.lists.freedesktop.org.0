Yes you can as the kobject in the kset should NOT be controling the
lifespan of those larger objects.

If it is, please point out the call chain here as I don't think that
should be possible.

Note all of this is a mess because the kobject name stuff was added much
later, after the driver model had been created and running for a while.
We missed this error path when adding the dynamic kobject name logic,
thank for looking into this.

If you could test the patch posted with your error injection systems,
that could make this all much simpler to solve.

thanks,
