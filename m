We choose lazy fixup for 2 reasons. 

- If some threads were already created before the MSR is programmed, then
  we need to fixup those in a race free way. scheduling some task-work etc.
  We did do that early on, but decided it was ugly. 
- Not all threads need to submit ENQCMD, force feeding the MSR probably
  isn't even required for all. Yes the overhead isn't probably big, but
  might not even be required for all threads.

We needed to fixup MSR in two different way. To keep the code simple, the
choice was to only fixup on #GP, that eliminated the extra code we need to
support case1.

Cheers,
Ashok
