I found one game which regresses spectacularly badly with this series - 
Assasin's Creed Valhalla. The built-in benchmark at least. The game 
appears to have a working set much larger than the other games I tested, 
around 5GiB total during the benchmark. And for some reason migration 
throttling totally fails to put it in check. I will be investigating 
this shortly.
