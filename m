Sure.  I think that is fine.  How about something like:

For reference, internally the CP consists of several sub-blocks (CPC -
CP compute, CPG - CP graphics, and CPF - CP fetcher).  Some of these
acronyms appear in register names, but this is more of an
implementation detail and not something that directly impacts driver
programming or debugging directly.
