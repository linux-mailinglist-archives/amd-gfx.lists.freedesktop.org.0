Oh, I agree that is broken by design, but this is already implemented 
with the current guilt system!

The ioctls already will return -ECANCELLED if you are guilty of a hang:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_cs.c#L64

The query merely exists to give more feedback as to the situation, which 
is fine.

I could probably get every RADV developer, and all of the Proton 
graphics team to come in and preach the same thing also. :P

If a compositor/display server is guilty of a hang, it can just listen 
for DEVICE_LOST from vkQueueSubmit and re-create it's context, re-import 
the dmabufs etc (or restart itself).

FWIU, in the email chain, the thing Daenzer was saying was that Firefox 
was falling back to software rendering even when it was innocent, but 
that seems incredibly broken by design.
