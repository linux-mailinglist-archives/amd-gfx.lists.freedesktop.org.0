We don't have to care about case 2 here. Broken apps will be handled by app
profiles. The problem is that some games don't work with the current limit
on the most powerful consumer APU we've ever made (Rembrandt) with
precisely the games that the APU was made for, and instead of increasing
the limit, we continue arguing about some TTM stuff that doesn't help
anything right now.
