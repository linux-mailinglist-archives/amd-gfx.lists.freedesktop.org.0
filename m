I think we can skip the warning if the flushing is coming from
cancel*_work_sync() as flush takes place iff the work item already has a
worker running - ie. it can't be blocked from lack of memory. Tvrtko, can
you write up a patch to exclude the condition from check_flush_dependency()?
I think it can just skip check_flush_dependency() when @from_cancel is set.

Taking a step back, if an actual dependency develops in the future - memory
reclaim actually blocking on gpu work items, one way to handle that would be
adding subsystem-wide workqueues so that the rescuer can be shared across
GPU drivers / devices. As long as they don't depend on each other for making
forward progress, which they most likely wouldn't, sharing a rescuer across
them is completely fine.

Thanks.
