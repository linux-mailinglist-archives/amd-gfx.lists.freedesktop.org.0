Yeah, especially as it sounds from some of the reports as if some
vendors did a really bad job when it came to setting the proper
lower-bound limits are now adhered -- and thus higher then what we used
out-of-the box before 1958946858a62b was applied.

Side note: I assume those "lower bounds checking" is done round about
the same way by the Windows driver? Does that one allow users to go
lower somehow? Say after modifying the registry or something like that?
Or through external tools?

Ciao, Thorsten
