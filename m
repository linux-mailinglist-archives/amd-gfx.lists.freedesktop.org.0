Well.  I don't drop fixes unless it's decided to be a non-issue or
unless a better fix is available.

I've done this for ever - I've held onto "wrong" fixes for *years*. 
View this as a weird issue-tracking system for a project which has no
issue-tracking system.  It's to prevent issues from falling through
cracks and getting lost.

It's unfortunate that this one causes disruption so I guess I'll loudly
comment it out and track the issue that way.
