s/Monitor0/MonitorA

(the Monitor0 and Monitor1 are actually Monitor4 (for the laptop) and
Montor0 (for the hdmi output), atleast i think that was the numbers.)
they were autogenerated Monitor identifiers by xorg, so i dont
remember the exact numbers, but either way, for some reason the
radeon's DisplayPort-1-2 was "using" the same monitor as modesetting's
eDP1
