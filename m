Hi Alex,

I added a few suggestions and questions.

I know GTT is part of the glossary, but to improve this part of the doc
readability, I suggested adding the acronym meaning the first time you
mentioned GTT. You already used this approach in the rest of this patch.

What do you mean by "common modes"? Maybe consider adding a brief
explanation or point to the documentation that explains it.

How about adding the path to the simple IB test that you mentioned?

/acess/access/

Just out of curiosity, what is the use for these debugfs? Why users
might want to use it? Can you get this binary from one device and load
it into another device for testing?

I repeat my previous question:

Can you get this binary from one device and load it into another device
for testing?

iirc, AMD has 3 reset modes. By full GPU reset, do you mean the Mode
that resets the entire device (mode 0?)?

When I checked this debugfs, it prints a non-human readable output
(maybe I did something wrong?). How can users use this output for
debugging? Is there a way to parser the output?

Same as my previous question.

I don't know how this error works. Is it something like this:

echo 23 > /sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/amdgpu_error_gfx # 23 is a random number

And if there is a fence error in the gfx ring, should I see the error
code 23 in the dmesg?

Is sa == SubAllocation?

What is GCA? Could you add this to the amdgpu glossary?

It looks like that GPR it is not part of the amdgpu glossary.

What is this attestation record?

Is this available for all GPUs and APUs?

I believe this page is directly related to the debugging page. In this
sense, maybe add a new section about the debugfs entries to the
debugging page.

Thanks
