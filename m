That's why we train the link; to determine what speed is reliable.  It
could be that there is a marginal trace on the motherboard that has
deteriorated over time or was never reliable to begin with.   It would
be interesting to know if the link used to work reliably on this
board.

I mean rather than checking the PCIe caps, check the current link
speed instead.  pcie_bandwidth_available() returns the speed and lanes
of the slowest link in the topology; what we want is the current speed
that the link upstream of the GPU is trained at.  If there is no
USB4/TB or limited speed bridge upstream of the GPU, then that
function should return the current speed of the link which would be
fine.  The problem is that
amdgpu_device_pcie_dynamic_switching_supported() returning false
disables PCIe DPM so we don't dynamically change the PCIe speed/lanes
at runtime.  I suspect that would work fine as long as we don't go
past the current speed the link is currently trained at.

Depends on whether it's a general problem or something specific to
this particular board.  I.e., the slot on this board has deteriorated.
I think what we want is to enable PCIe DPM, but just limit the link
the the max current speed rather than the max speed.  If the links are
reliable the links should train at the max speed on power up.
