Lijo had commented that limits are different for default and fast PPT, 
so we shouldn't be dropping that.  There is already a check in 
vangogh_set_power_limit() which is used for checking fast limits.

So to me it appears the issue here is with the handling of fast PPT. 
With that patch (Drop superfluous call to set_power_limit) in place do 
you see "New power limit (%d) is out of range" in the logs?

If not; maybe can you annotate with the v2 applied but not that "Drop 
superfluous call to set_power_limit" patch what each call to 
smu_set_power_limit() has for arguments and what max_power_limit, 
min_power_limit are.

I wonder if you're ending up with a call with a fast limit of 0.  If so; 
throw a dump_stack() in that condition so we can understand why.
I see max_fast_ppt_limit is hard coded to 30 in vangogh_ppt.
