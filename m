First and foremost, it returns the evicted size of VRAM and visible VRAM,
and returns visible VRAM usage. It should be obvious which stat includes
the size of another.

I don't know what you mean. The returned eviction stats look correct and
are stable (they don't change much). You can suggest changes if you think
some numbers are not reported correctly.

The VRAM overcommit value is "evicted_vram".

Nothing uses fdinfo in Mesa. No driver uses sysfs in Mesa except drm shims,
noop drivers, and Intel for perf metrics. sysfs itself is an unusable mess
for the PCIe query and is missing information.

I'm not against exposing more stuff through sysfs and fdinfo for tools, but
I don't see any reason why drivers should use it (other than for slowing
down queries and initialization).
