 Christian,

This is going to be very interesting.
So the AMD Radeon AI R9700 Pro is running over USB4v2 into a Razor Dock on
a 650W power supply I have two of these setups cards provided by AMD for
some project testing on tb5 rocm ai broadcast messages for testing two
machines connected over tb5 with rdma sorry if I loose you here. What I am
seeing or finding in my opinion is thunderbolt is not very well flushed out
on Linux in terms of stability and accessible feature sets. After my kernel
pci patch I have gotten it to work which we went over already.

I have one machine running Qwen3.5 27B A3B on the GPU with llamacpp /
lemonade successfully but yesterday after attempting to load the model
which it did into vram it crashed which ten minutes prior was running a
prompt 73k tokens at 40tps. A side note The power management on Thunderbolt
seems to clash with the power management on the GPU. What I was seeing is
when the GPU doesn=E2=80=99t detect a display it =E2=80=9Csuspends=E2=80=9D=
 which may be correct or
not but it doesn=E2=80=99t matter either way in this scenario. The Thunderb=
olt
fabric I believe shuts down also and kills the link. I got passed this by
disabling all PM systems. So I=E2=80=99m not 100% sure what=E2=80=99s going=
 on and how to
find the actual problem yet maybe if I spend more time and brain power on
this I=E2=80=99ll find where in power management it=E2=80=99s having the pr=
oblem or if
that=E2=80=99s the real problem. Let me know if you can offer anymore guida=
nce into
where I should dig. I appreciate the help this far and the SMU information
helps get more context.

&gt; Hi Christian,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I appreciate the speedy response,<br>
&gt; What your saying makes sense they are basically wrapping symptoms that=
 could at least from what I seen now at this point only continue and eventu=
ally create a web of useless code to try to catch all code paths it hits du=
ring crashing. Let me investigate the real reason as to why it=E2=80=99s cr=
ashing more rather then where.<br>
<br>
To just give you a bit background on what happens here:<br>
<br>
AMD GPUs have an embedded micro controller called SMU which takes care of t=
hings like voltages, clocks, temperature, fan speed etc.. and reset.<br>
<br>
So when the kernel driver detects that it needs to do a reset it sends a MO=
DE1 reset command to the SMU. But instead of the SMU coming back a short ti=
me later noting that the reset was done the device just drops off the bus (=
e.g. all reads return 0xffffffff).<br>
<br>
The cause of that can be anything, e.g. from power fluctuations to a dirty =
fan which doesn&#39;t starts to rotate again after it was stopped.<br>
<br>
I would try to narrow it down step by step, e.g. if it work on older kernel=
s, if yes what feature/patch broke the behavior. You can also try to disabl=
e certain power management features like ASPM (try amdgpu.aspm=3D0 on the k=
ernel command line).<br>
<br>
Hope that helps,<br>
Christian.<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0IIRC a MODE1 reset should keep the bus active and s=

&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; All subsequent PCIe<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0That sounds more like the MODE1 reset failed.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; After MODE1 reset completes, check whether the=
 PCIe endpoint is still<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; reachable using pci_device_is_present(). If th=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Thunderbolt and the link is dead, walk up pare=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset() to retrain th=
e physical PCIe link<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; inside the dock.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Well that is then a bus reset.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I mean that is a reasonable mitigation when a MODE1=
 reset failed, but the question is rather why does the MODE1 reset fails in=
 the first place?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; If recovery fails, return -ENODEV to prevent t=
he<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; reset retry loop.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; This also causes the GPU fan to be at 100% and=
 basically when it<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; happens and you are not there, you now have a =
GPU with fan at 100% and<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; cant reset it.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; I wanted to notate some other things I am find=
ing sometimes before<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; this adventure of patches to the kernel and am=
dgpu driver.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Sometimes a crash could happen in the drive an=
d then the GPU fan speed<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; hits 100% and the air is hot coming out withou=
t any workload, other<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; times<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; I have seen it have barely any fan speed at al=
l and heat up more than<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; it should at the fan level its curently operat=
ing at. These are things<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; I have seen with this gpu in a TB5 dock with t=
he driver and<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; instability. I&#39;m not sure exactly whats go=
ing on there but I figured<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; since im communicating with these patches I mi=
ght as well bring you up<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; to speed and supermario has been great help th=
roughout me trying to<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; get the AMD AI R9700 Pro working on my MS-S1 H=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; USB4v2 dock!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Adding Mario as well. That strongly sounds like you=
 crashed the SMU which would also explain the failed MODE1 reset.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0But all of that are only symptoms. Question is what=
 is actually going on here? e.g. what is the root cause?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; It seems to be finally working with bar resizi=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Then it rebuilds it afterwords with the increa=
