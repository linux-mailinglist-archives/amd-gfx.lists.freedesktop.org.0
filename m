Yes and that is really valued.

If we can get that working and and it is feature equivalent to radeon 
I'm perfectly fine to merge this.

No, that should only be necessary for UVD.

Leo and I can push once more on this, but no guarantee that this will 
ever see the day of light.

It was a really long and taxing process of getting UVD for SI out of the 
door.

Unfortunately not, we only have what was exposed with the initial code drop.

Do you have an example of what you need?

Sorry, I don't think we can help with documentation here. What I can do 
is to test your stuff on SI hardware if you get stuck with something and 
report back what might be the issue.

You mean the 24 bit address limitation of UVD, don't you? That should 
not apply to VCE in general.

Let's try to get it working first.

For radeon we are more or less in a maintenance mode. If it just adds 
comments then we can certainly add it, but if you have any functional 
change I would be a bit hesitated.

Christian.
