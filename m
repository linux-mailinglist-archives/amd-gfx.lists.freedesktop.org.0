Yes.  on boot up, the GOP driver loads and initializes the hardware,
enumerates the attached displays, and lights them up.  Once the OS
loads, the pre-OS environment is gone, so the GOP driver is gone.  The
OS just inherits the memory and timings that the GOP driver set up.
Then the OS loads the OS driver which enumerates the displays and
lights them up, etc.  When you unload the OS driver and you want to
use the hardware again, something has to re-initialize it.
