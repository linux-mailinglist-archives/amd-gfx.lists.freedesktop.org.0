Hello,

I see you are listed in the MAINTAINERS for Radeon / AMDGPU.

I would greatly appreciate your advice in the best route to a triage and fix for the following:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217690

It makes it difficult to have a consistently stable Lenovo ThinkPad Z16 which I think is one of the best available AMD & Radeon laptops out today, and listed as supporting Linux officially.

I have about 30 years of programming experience, though none of it was on GPUs, so please let me know what I might be able to do in order to help figure this out.

Sincerely,
Matthew Hall
