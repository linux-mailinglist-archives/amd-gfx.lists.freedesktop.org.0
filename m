I'm not sure about that tbh, since the example you gave also still mentions VC
#1 which is supposed to be disabled here.

FWIW, I was alerted to this pecularity when I noticed Figure 2-93 from chapter
2.6.5 of the DP 2.0 spec. Notice that on the diagram it mentions time slots 1-
20 allocated to VC1, time slots 21-32 being allocated to VC2, and then
(confusingly in a different color) mentions that time slots 33-47 are
allocated to VC1 again.

At first I honestly thought this was a typo in the spec, but it's done
multiple times and it _does_ actually make sense when you think about it for a
little while. Consider that the advantage of having VC allocations work this
way would be that you're able to increase the time slots allocated to a VC
without having to even change their start slots - meaning those other payloads
don't need to be disrupted in any way. This is only as far as I can tell if
you have non-contiguous payloads.
