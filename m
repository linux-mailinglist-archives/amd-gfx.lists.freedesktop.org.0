+/**
+ * DOC: Memory_Types
+ *
+ * There are many different types of memory that KFD can manage, each with
+ * slightly different interfaces
+ *
+ * VRAM and GTT
+ * ------------
+ *
+ * VRAM and GTT can be allocated with the AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU ioctl.
+ * This ioctl returns a handle used to refer to the memory in future kfd ioctls,
+ * as well as a mmap_offset used for mapping the allocation on the CPU. VRAM
+ * memory is located on the GPU, while GTT memory is located in host memory.
+ * Once memory is allocated, it must be mapped with the
+ * AMD_KFD_IOC_MAP_MEMORY_TO_GPU ioctl before the GPU can access it.
+ *
+ * Doorbell and MMIO
+ * -----------------
+ *
+ * Each process is assigned two pages of doorbell memory used to signal that
+ * usermode queues have awaiting packets. AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU
+ * associates these pages with a virtual address. They must still be mapped if
+ * the GPU is to access them.
+ *
+ * There is one page of MMIO memory per GPU that is accessible to userspace by
+ * the same means.
+ *
+ * userptr
+ * -------
+ *
+ * userptr memory is user-allocated system memory, alloacted with malloc or
+ * similar. As with doorbell and MMIO memory, AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU
+ * does not allocate the memory; instead it registers existing memory for
+ * mapping.
+ *
+ * SVM
+ * ---
+ *
+ * SVM is a different memory-allocation API available on GFX9+. Like userptr
+ * memory, SVM maps existing user-managed memory onto the GPU.
+ *
+ * XNACK is an SVM feature that is disabled by default as it has a performance
+ * cost. When XNACK is enabled, SVM memory can perform recoverable page faults,
+ * allowing KFD to allocate memory without reserving physical address space,
+ * performing the physical allocation only on page fault. With XNACK, SVM
+ * uses the Heterogenous Memory Manager (HMM) to migrate pages back and forth
+ * between the device and the host in reponse to memory pressure and page faults.
+ *
+ * Scratch
+ * -------
+ *
+ * Scratch memory is VRAM memory on a GPU reserved for holding intermediate
+ * values during a shader's execution. A user (usually ROCr) can allocate
+ * scratch memory by allocating VRAM memory and then using the
+ * AMDKFD_IOC_SET_SCRATCH_BACKING_VA ioctl.
+ */
+
+/**
+ * DOC: Memory_Implementation
+ *
+ * The GPU page tables need to be kept in sync with the CPU page tables; if a
+ * page is moved, swapped, or evicted by linux's normal memory manager, a callback
+ * is made into kfd, which must pause hardware access to the memory while the
+ * operation is in progress.
+ *
+ * Compute shaders can cause thrashing if the total memory in use exceeds the
+ * GPU or system's memory limits. Because user command submission is via
+ * usermode queues, with no driver involvement, all memory must be physically
+ * resident at all times (this is different from the graphics approach, which
+ * can swap memory on and off the GPU as needed). KFD prevents overcommitment
+ * of memory by keeping an account of how much memory processes have allocated,
+ * and refusing to allocate beyond a threshold.

+/**
+ * DOC: Discovery
+ *
+ * There are two phases of initialization and topology discovery in KFD. The
+ * first, module_init occurs when the module is built into the kernel (on boot
+ * or modprobe). The second, device_init, occurs when linux discovers a PCI
+ * device that is an AMD GPU (on boot or hotplug).
+ *
+ * module_init begins when the amdgpu driver is initialized (amdgpu_drv.c),
+ * which calls kfd_init() in kfd_module.c. At this time, the chardev is created
+ * so that ioctls can be submitted, and the topology is queried, creating the
+ * sysfs layout. Some AMD APUs make their topology information
+ * available through a BIOS structure called a CRAT table. If no CRAT table is
+ * found, KFD will make one up with the information available to it. Discrete
+ * GPUs are not discovered at this time; only CPUs and APUs. At this
+ * point, AMDGPU registers itself as a PCIe driver.
+ *
+ * device_init begins when linux finds a device with a PCIe ID matching an entry
+ * amdgpu is registered for. If the device contains compute functionality,
+ * amdgpu will call kgd2kfd_probe() and kgd2kfd_device_init() in kfd_device.c
+ * (kgd2kfd stands for Kernel Graphics Driver to Kernel Fusion Driver) to set up
+ * shared resources such as non-compute doorbells and add the new device to the
+ * topology.

+/**
+ * DOC: Queue_Interface
+ *
+ * A process can create queues with the ioctl AMDKFD_IOC_CREATE_QUEUE, which
+ * returns a queue id used as a handle, the addresses of the read and write
+ * pointers, and the doorbell location. Up to 256 processes can have queues,
+ * and each process can have up to 1024 queues.
+ *
+ * A doorbell is a 64-bit memory-mapped register on the GPU that a
+ * process can write to to signal that the corresponding queue has packets
+ * waiting in it.
+ *
+ * A queue can be either an compute queue, used for computation, or an SDMA queue,
+ * used for data transfers.
+ *
+ * Most HSA queues take commands in the form of 64-byte AQL packets. Most
+ * commonly, this will be a kernel dispatch packet containing a pointer to the
+ * kernel to be executed. A kernel is a small program that performs an
+ * elementary operation such as a vector sum, matrix multiplication, or
+ * scatter-gather operation. A single user program may be made up of many
+ * kernels. Other AQL packets include barrier packets used for synchronization
+ * between shaders and PM4_IB packets that flush the cache, used for profiling.
+ * Packets in the same queue will begin execution in order, but can run
+ * concurrently. DMA queues are similar, but use a different packet format.
+ *
+ * A queue contains a ringbuffer with read and write pointers used to submit
+ * packets (the size of the ringbuffer is specified when the queue is
+ * created). To write to a queue, a process first atomically moves the
+ * write pointer forward. Then, it writes each of the packets to the buffer,
+ * leaving the headers empty so that if hardware attempts to consume the packets
+ * at this point, it will find them invalid. Then it writes the headers and
+ * signals the doorbell.
+ *
+ * In addition to the user mode queues described here, there are kernel mode
+ * queues used internally by KFD to communicate with various elements of the
+ * hardware; these work similarly.
+ */
+
+/**
+ * DOC: Queue_Implementation
+ *
+ * Although there may be thousands of queues attached to processes, the 
+ * hardware engines have a limited number of queue slots, usually 32 or fewer 
+ * compute and 10 or fewer DMA per GPU. The hardware will detect doorbell 
+ * signals directly only from queues mapped to an engine. The hardware
+ * scheduler will periodically poll for unmapped queues with work waiting and
+ * map them, unmapping empty queues to make room.
+ *
+ * Compute shaders can be interrupted partway through execution by the hardware
+ * scheduler. In that case, the shader's current state will be saved to a
+ * usermode buffer so it can be restored at a later time. These buffers are
+ * large, and each queue requires its own buffer, so queues are memory-expensive
+ * objects. The context save/restore process is initiated with a trap handler on
+ * the GPU. The trap handler itself is located in the driver, written in SP3
+ * assembly code.

+ * DOC: Topology
+ *
+ * The GPU component of an APU or iGPU, or a discrete GPU, is a GPU device. The
+ * CPU is also a device (known as "System" or "Host" to KFD).
+ *
+ * A node is a memory domain. Most devices are a single node, but certain GPUs
+ * may contain multiple nodes, depending on how they are configured. Each GPU
+ * node has its own L2 data cache.
+ *
+ * A GPU contains multiple Shader Engines (SEs). Each shader engine has its own
+ * sub-scheduler to divide up work within the SE.
+ *
+ * A Shader Engine contains multiple Compute Units (CUs). All processing in a
+ * CU will share all caches, such that two threads running in the same
+ * CU will be able to easily communicate and synchronize
+ *
+ * A Compute Unit contains multiple Single Instruction Multiple Data units
+ * (SIMDs). A SIMD can run programs that perform operations on 32- or 64-element
+ * vectors. A program running on a single SIMD is called a wavefront.
+ *
+ * In addition to the processing capabilities, the topology also includes the
+ * IO links between nodes. GPU nodes may be connected to each other or the
+ * system via XGMI or PCIe links.
+ *
+ * Topology information is available through sysfs at
+ * /sys/devices/virtual/kfd/kfd/topology or through symbolic link at
+ * /sys/class/kfd/kfd/topology. The generation_id field in that directory is
