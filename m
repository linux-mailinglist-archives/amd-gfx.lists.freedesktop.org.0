Uh ... problem is that dma_buf_vmap are usually permanent things. Maybe we
could stuff this into begin/end_cpu_access (but only for the kernel, so a
bit tricky)?

btw the other issue with dma-buf (and even worse with dma_fence) is
refcounting of the underlying drm_device. I'd expect that all your
callbacks go boom if the dma_buf outlives your drm_device. That part isn't
yet solved in your series here.
