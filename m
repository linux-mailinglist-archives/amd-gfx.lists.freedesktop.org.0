It's the same thing as ever. 90% of an accel driver are in userspace,
that's where all the fun is, that's where the big picture review needs to
happen, and we've very conveniently bypassed all that a few years back
because it was too annoying.

Once we have the full driver stack and can start reviewing it I have no
objections to totally-not-gpus using all this stuff too. But until we can
do that this is all just causing headaches.

Ofc if you assume that userspace doesn't matter then you don't care, which
is where this giantic disconnect comes from.

Also unless we're actually doing this properly there's zero incentive for
me to review the kernel code and check whether it follows the rules
correctly, so you have excellent chances that you just break the rules.
And dma_buf/fence are tricky enough that you pretty much guaranteed to
break the rules if you're not involved in the discussions. Just now we
have a big one where everyone involved (who's been doing this for 10+
years all at least) realizes we've fucked up big time.

Anyway we've had this discussion, we're not going to move anyone here at
all, so *shrug*. I'll keep seeing accelarators in drivers/misc as blantant
bypassing of review by actual accelerator pieces, you keep seing dri-devel
as ... well I dunno, people who don't know what they're talking about
maybe. Or not relevant to your totally-not-a-gpu thing.

There's no import afaict, but maybe I missed it. Assuming I haven't missed
it the importing necessarily has to happen by some other drivers.
