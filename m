Sounds like passthrough of 10 bpc values should work fine with your patch=

Are there issues describing those use cases?

That doesn't really make sense, the output of the display HW colour pipel=
ine has more than 10 bpc regardless of framebuffer format.

Seems pretty bad to me, mixing up things which aren't directly related.
