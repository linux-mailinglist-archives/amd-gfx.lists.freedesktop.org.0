Hi again Alex,

First, a follow up on VDDCI. From some sources I've found, I
understand that it would be the VDD at the interface. Which interface
is unclear, but one source was referring to the voltage at the PCIe
interface. Would that make sense?

Next, I'd like your thoughts and inputs on a project I'd like to work
on (in fact, I've been working on it in the last few weeks already).
I'd like to bring BACO on par with CI. I know there is a minimal
implementation for reset purposes already present. I think it is
linked to the legacy dpm. And then, I'd like to go as far as possible
in moving from the legacy DPM code to use the same (or similar) code
path used by CI+. Do you think this could work?

Also, was SMU6 significantly different from SMU7? Looking at how the
driver sends messages to SMU7 and 8, it looks like an iterative
process where new messages/features were added to the previous SMU
version. Can we expect SMU6 to work mostly like the two subsequent
versions with a subset of their supported messages/features?

Finally, was SMU6 able to use any of the power tune features? CI is
able to receive a request to use one of a few power profiles. Was this
only available from CI or was it also present under SI?

Thank you very much for your time and knowledge and have a great
Holidays season.
