I'm not entirely convinced that we need the struct drm_backlight_override
abstraction right away. Maybe we can start with just a
drm_connector_get_cmdline_min_brightness_override() which just returns an int?

If you prefer to keep the struct drm_backlight_override that is fine too,
we can see what others think when you submit a new version for review.

I have not looked at that code i quite a while, so you're probably right.
