Can you please suggest an edit that explains these better?

I'm sorry to say, I thought I understood it but after reading your
reply now I feel I don't.

Not sure what you mean by "the average developer", but I think this is
very useful knowledge to anyone who wants to contribute to amdgpu,
specifically to the parts that have anything to do with GFX or compute.

If you're worried that it may not stay consistent over time, I think
the glossary entries could be edited to mention which GPU generation(s)
they apply to.

As-is the code is full of 3-letter abbreviations that are never
expanded or explained anywhere, which represent various hardware units
(or microcontrollers, or blocks, or whatever they may be). Without
knowing what these are and how they interact, it's difficult to
understand what the code is doing any why, or even why some parts are
necessary.

To make matters worse, the latest public documentation that tries to
explain any of this is from 2012. So I think it's a good idea to
collect all of this information so that newcomers to the kernel driver
such as myself have a chance.

Thanks & best regards,
Timur
