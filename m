Check your xorg log.

If you want to render on the dGPU and display on the integrated GPU,
then the content will have to traverse the bus.

For optimal performance, dGPUs will want to render to local vram.  So
when a dGPU is rendering it will render to a buffer in vram.  However,
if the display is connected to the integrated GPU, it can't directly
access the buffer in the dGPU's vram.  In order to transfer the buffer
from the dGPU to the integrated GPU for display, it has to be copied
from vram to buffer in system memory.  This buffer is then shared with
the integrated GPU.  Depending on the integrated GPU's capabilities,
it may be able to use the buffer as is, or it may have to copy the
buffer again to a buffer that it can display from.

If you are mainly concerned with checking the performance of the the
dGPU itself (where the dGPU handles display and rendering), I would
make sure your desktop environment is configured to be running on the
dGPU only.  Take the integrated GPU out of the picture.

If the integrated GPU is the primary display, turning the displays off
or closing the lid may signal to the integarted GPU driver that it's
not in use so it can power down.  So it may go to a lower power state
which has a relatively high exit latency.  Every time a copy is
required the integrated GPU has to wake up and do the copy.  The copy
is probably not necessary, but I'm not sure how well optimized most
display servers are in this regard.  Really if all the displays on one
GPU are off and the display server should fallback to same GPU render
and display, but I'm not sure how well this is handled.  The current
multi-GPU support in X is mostly focused on the following two use
cases:
1. Hybrid graphics, where you have a integrated GPU which handles
displays and you have a dGPU which is mainly for render offload.  The
render GPU renders content and it it shared with the display GPU.
2. Multi-GPU displays, where you have a large desktop spread across
multiple GPUs.  The render GPU renders content and it is shared with
the display GPUs.
