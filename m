Fair enough.  I don't have a strong opinion on the matter.  Users will
hopefully likely notice the failure after release because most people
don't test until after a release and then we'll apply the fix and
re-enable it for 5.20 so that would leave 5.19 broken for PPC64 users
which would not be ideal.  But as you said, no one has cared up to
this point.
