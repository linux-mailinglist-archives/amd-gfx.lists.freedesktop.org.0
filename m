Not really, no. They achieve higher "effective" (as perceived by the user) bpc using a lower physical bpc.

If DSC encodes user-perceived 10 bpc at a lower physical bpc, and the "link bpc" property reports 10, that would satisfy my concern for DSC.

Are you sure that's the case though?

I would be quite surprised if this was correspondingly the case for dithering.

Either way, the "link bpc" semantics regarding these should be explicitly documented.

Sounds like you misunderstood my concern.

I'm not assuming, I'm asking for this to be clarified.

Not sure why you keep attacking me personally. I'm not trying to shoot down your proposal, I'm trying to prevent potential flaws I see with it. A bit more cooperative attitude would be nice.

The start of this thread is the cover letter of a 3-patch series.

More ad hominem.

This isn't a good-faith argument either. Nobody asked for that.
