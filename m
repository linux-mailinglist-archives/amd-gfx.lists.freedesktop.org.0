I'm now running with patch 3 applied correctly, and with patch 5 as well.


The good news is that I'm now seeing a positive effect with GpuTest benchmarks which are GPU-limited at low frame rates. In particular, with the pixmark piano benchmark, the GNOME Wayland session now actually stays more responsive on this machine than it does on my work laptop with an Intel iGPU. However, with the plot3d benchmark (with /plot3d_vertex_density=1750 on the command line to increase GPU load), it still doesn't quite manage to keep the desktop running at full frame rate, in contrast to the Intel iGPU.

The bad news is that this series still makes some things very slow. The most extreme examples so far are glxgears (runs at ~400 fps now, ~7000 fps before, i.e. almost 20x slowdown) and hexchat (scrolling one page now takes ~1 second, I can see it drawing line by line; before it was almost instantaneous). I suspect this series makes the overhead of running a single GPU job much bigger. On the bright side, I'm not noticing any significant intermittent freezes anymore.


In summary, while the benefits are promising, the downsides are unacceptable for enabling this by default.
