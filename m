Thanks for writing this! It does help with the transparency.

Please find a comment inline.

So we've debated this one before. :)

Again, I applaud the transparency in writing the document, but I can't
help feeling the weekly promotions are code drops that will generally be
merged unchanged, with no comments. They have all been reviewed
internally, get posted with Reviewed-by tags pre-filled, we have no
visibility to the review. Since the code has already been merged
internally and the batch has passed CI, feels like the bar for changing
anything at this point is pretty high.

Just my two cents.


BR,
Jani.
