Doe AMD have documentation on the i2c data that gets sent currently though?=
 I was hoping to figure out what you need to change in the command that get=
s sent to change stuff like brightness, color (red, green, blue), rainbow, =
morse code, etc.

> IIRC, each AIB/OEM uses its own preferred RGB controller. The reference b=
oard just defines which i2c buses can be used. The RGB control application =
is just a userspace app provided by the AIB/OEM that calls ADL to talk to w=
hichever i2c bus the vendor put their RGB controller on. On Linux you can d=
o something similar using the i2c_dev module to open a connection to the i2=
c bus driver provided by the kernel. I believe that is what openRGB does to=
day. It looks like you already have the programming sequence above.
