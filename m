So 10 years ago we had this world of every gpu driver is its own bucket,
nothing leaks out to the world. But the world had a different idea how
gpus where supposed to work, with stuff like:

- laptops with a power-efficient but slow gpu integrated on the cpu die,
  and a 2nd, much faster but also more wasteful gpu seperately

- also multi-gpu rendering (but on linux we never really got around to
  enabling that, at least not for 3d rendering)

- soc just bundle IP blocks together, and very often they feel like they
  have to do their own display block (it's fairly easy and allows you to
  keep your hw engineers justified on payroll with some more patents they
  create), but anything more fancy they buy in. So from a driver
  architecture pov even a single chip soc looks like a bundle of gpus

And you want to pipeline all this because performance, so waiting in
userspace for one block to finish before you hand it ever to the other
isn't a good idea.

Hence dma_fence as a cross driver leak was created by pulling the gpu
completion tracking from the drm/ttm library for managing vram.

Now with glorious hindsight we could have come up with a different
approach, where synchronization is managed by userspace, kernel just
provides some primitives (kinda like futexes, but for gpu). And the kernel
manages residency and gpu pte wrangling entirely seperately. But:

- 10 years ago drivers/gpu was a handful of people at best

- we just finished the massive rewrite to get to a kernel memory manager
  and kernel modesetting (over 5 years after windows/macos), so appetite
  for massive rewrites was minimal.

Here we are, now with 50 more drivers built on top and an entire userspace
ecosystem that relies on all this (because yes we made dma_fence also the
building block for all the cross-process uapi, why wouldn't we).

I hope that explains a bit the history of how and why we ended up here.

Maybe I should do a plumbers talk about "How not to memory manage -
cautious tales from drivers/gpu" I think there's a lot of areas where the
conversation usually goes "wtf" ... long explanation of history and
technical reasons leading to a "oh dear". With a lot of other accelerators
and things landing might be good to have a list of things that look
tempting (because hey 2% faster) but arent worth the pain.
