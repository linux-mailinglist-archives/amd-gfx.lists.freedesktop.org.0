Those are 4k by default on modern systems as well and while over allocating them to 64k is possible that not only wastes some VRAM but can also result in OOM situations because we can't allocate the necessary page tables to switch from 2MiB to 4k pages in some cases.


Sorry, Cristian — I may be misunderstanding this point, so I would 
appreciate some clarification.

If the CPU page size is 64K and the GPU page size is 4K, then from the 
GPU side the page table entries are created and mapped at 4K 
granularity, while on the CPU side the pages remain 64K. To map a single 
CPU page to the GPU, we therefore need to create multiple GPU page table 
entries for that CPU page.

We found that this was not being handled correctly in the SVM path and 
addressed it with the change in patch 2/8.

Given this, if the memory is allocated and mapped in GPU page-size (4K) 
granularity on the GPU side, could you please clarify how memory waste 
occurs in this scenario?

Thank you for your time and guidance.
