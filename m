Well SRIOV time-sharing is for virtualization. cgroups is for
containerization, which is just virtualization but with less overhead and
more security bugs.

More or less.

So either I get things still wrong, or we'll get time-sharing for
virtualization, and partitioning of CU for containerization. That doesn't
make that much sense to me.

Since time-sharing is the first thing that's done for virtualization I
think it's probably also the most reasonable to start with for containers.
