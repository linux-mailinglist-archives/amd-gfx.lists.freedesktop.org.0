You do prevent future submissions for regular resets though: Those 
increase karma which sets ctx->guilty, and if ctx->guilty then 
-ECANCELED is returned for a submission.

ctx->guilty is never true for soft recovery though, as it doesn't 
increase karma, which is the problem this patch is trying to solve.

By the submission result query API, I you assume you mean checking the 
submission fence error somehow? That doesn't seem very ergonomic for a 
Vulkan driver compared to the simple solution which is to just mark it 
as guilty with what already exists...
