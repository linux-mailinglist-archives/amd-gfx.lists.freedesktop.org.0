Not specifically. I just know from experience to not
rely on chassis type.

E.g. I would not be surprised to have some of the desktop-replacement
class laptops from e.g. clevo which sometimes even come with
a desktop CPU for moar power, have their chassis type wrong.

Granted those are not using AMD APUs (yet), but that might change
with the ryzen 7000 series where every CPU is an APU too...

I agree this is unlikely. But I have seen all sort of wrong
chassis-type settings in devices which are not from the
big OEMs.  And AFAIK these sometimes also play fasr and loose
with the Windows certification.

Doing both sounds like a good idea, I like it.

It would be great if you can rework the series to just cancel
the timeout from acpi_video_report_nolcd() + add a patch
to change the default register_backlight_delay to 0.

Adding the patch for default of 0 sounds great, thanks.
