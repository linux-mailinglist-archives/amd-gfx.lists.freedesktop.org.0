Google has sponsored 30k in hosting credits last year, these simply
ran out _much_ faster than anyone planned for. So this is by far not a
free thing for them. Plus there's also other companies sponsoring CI
runners and what not else in equally substantial amounts, plus the
biggest thing, sponsored admin time (more or less officially). So
there's a _lot_ of room for companies like Red Hat to sponsor without
throwing any money in google's revenue stream.

Or it doesn't happen, and then yeah the decision has already been made
to shutter the CI services. So this is also a question of whether we
(as a community and all the companies benefitting from the work done)
really want this, or maybe not quite.
