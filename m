Suggest you use something more demanding that glxgears as a test - part of =
the problem is that glxgears runs so fast normally (30x faster than your di=
splay) that even a small amount of overhead copying a frame from one place =
to another makes a huge difference in FPS.

If you use a test program that normally runs at 90 FPS you'll probably find=
 that the "slow" speed is something like 85 FPS, rather than the 6:1 differ=
ence you see with glxgears.

Subject: Re: slow rx 5600 xt fps

thanks for the answers alex.

so, i went ahead and got a displayport cable to see if that changes
anything. and now, when i run monitor only, and the monitor connected
to the card, it has no issues like before! so i am thinking that
somethings up with either the hdmi cable, or some hdmi related setting
in my system? who knows, but im just gonna roll with only using
displayport cables now.
the previous hdmi cable was actually pretty long, because i was
extending it with an hdmi extension cable, so maybe the signal was
really bad or something :/

but yea, i guess the only real issue now is maybe something simple
related to some sysfs entry about enabling some powermode, voltage,
clock frequency, or something, so that glxgears will give me more than
300 fps. but atleast now i can use a single monitor configuration with
the monitor displayported up to the card.

also, one other thing i think you might be interested in, that was
happening before.

so, previously, with laptop -tb3-> egpu-hdmi> monitor, there was a
funny thing happening which i never could figure out.
when i would look at the X logs, i would see that "modesetting" (for
the intel integrated graphics) was reporting that MonitorA was used
with "eDP-1",  which is correct and what i expected.
when i scrolled further down, i then saw that "HDMI-A-1-2" was being
used for another MonitorB, which also is what i expected (albeit i
have no idea why its saying A-1-2)
but amdgpu was _also_ saying that DisplayPort-1-2 (a port on the
radeon card) was being used for MonitorA, which is the same Monitor
that the modesetting driver had claimed to be using with eDP-1!

so the point is that amdgpu was "using" Monitor0 with DisplayPort-1-2,
although that is what modesetting was using for eDP-1.

anyway, thats a little aside, i doubt it was related to the terrible
hdmi experience i was getting, since its about display port and stuff,
but i thought id let you know about that.

if you think that is a possible issue, im more than happy to plug the
hdmi setup back in and create an issue on gitlab with the logs and
everything

Suggest you use something more demanding that glxgears as a test - part of =
the problem is that glxgears runs so fast normally (30x faster than your di=

 in FPS. <br>

If you use a test program that normally runs at 90 FPS you'll probably find=

<br>
so, i went ahead and got a displayport cable to see if that changes<br>
anything. and now, when i run monitor only, and the monitor connected<br>
to the card, it has no issues like before! so i am thinking that<br>
somethings up with either the hdmi cable, or some hdmi related setting<br>
in my system? who knows, but im just gonna roll with only using<br>
displayport cables now.<br>
the previous hdmi cable was actually pretty long, because i was<br>
extending it with an hdmi extension cable, so maybe the signal was<br>
really bad or something :/<br>
<br>
but yea, i guess the only real issue now is maybe something simple<br>
related to some sysfs entry about enabling some powermode, voltage,<br>
clock frequency, or something, so that glxgears will give me more than<br>
300 fps. but atleast now i can use a single monitor configuration with<br>
the monitor displayported up to the card.<br>
<br>
also, one other thing i think you might be interested in, that was<br>
happening before.<br>
<br>
so, previously, with laptop -tb3-&gt; egpu-hdmi&gt; monitor, there was a<br=
>
funny thing happening which i never could figure out.<br>
when i would look at the X logs, i would see that &quot;modesetting&quot; (=
for<br>
the intel integrated graphics) was reporting that MonitorA was used<br>
with &quot;eDP-1&quot;,&nbsp; which is correct and what i expected.<br>
when i scrolled further down, i then saw that &quot;HDMI-A-1-2&quot; was be=
ing<br>
used for another MonitorB, which also is what i expected (albeit i<br>
have no idea why its saying A-1-2)<br>
but amdgpu was _also_ saying that DisplayPort-1-2 (a port on the<br>
radeon card) was being used for MonitorA, which is the same Monitor<br>
that the modesetting driver had claimed to be using with eDP-1!<br>
<br>
so the point is that amdgpu was &quot;using&quot; Monitor0 with DisplayPort=
-1-2,<br>
although that is what modesetting was using for eDP-1.<br>
<br>
anyway, thats a little aside, i doubt it was related to the terrible<br>
hdmi experience i was getting, since its about display port and stuff,<br>
but i thought id let you know about that.<br>
<br>
if you think that is a possible issue, im more than happy to plug the<br>
hdmi setup back in and create an issue on gitlab with the logs and<br>
everything<br>

&gt; &gt; numbers of optimizations that are only now becoming possible on L=

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; whoa, i figured linux would be ahead of windows when it comes to<=

&gt; &gt; things like that. but peer-to-peer dma is something that is only<=
br>
&gt; &gt; recently possible on linux, but has been possible on windows? wha=
t<br>
&gt; &gt; changed recently that allows for peer to peer dma in linux?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A few things that made this more complicated on Linux:<br>
&gt; 1. Linux uses IOMMUs more extensively than windows so you can't just<b=
r>
&gt; pass around physical bus addresses.<br>
&gt; 2. Linux supports lots of strange architectures that have a lot of<br>
&gt; limitations with respect to peer to peer transactions<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; It just took years to get all the necessary bits in place in Linux and=
<br>
&gt; make everyone happy.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; also, in the context of a game running opengl on some gpu, is the=
<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; dma transfer something like: the game dr=
aw's to some<br>
&gt; &gt; memory it has allocated, then a DMA transfer gets that and moves =
it<br>
&gt; &gt; into the graphics card output?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Peer to peer DMA just lets devices access another devices local memory=
<br>
&gt; directly.&nbsp; So if you have a buffer in vram on one device, you can=
<br>
&gt; share that directly with another device rather than having to copy it<=
br>
&gt; to system memory first.&nbsp; For example, if you have two GPUs, you c=
an<br>
&gt; have one of them copy it's content directly to a buffer in the other<b=
r>
&gt; GPU's vram rather than having to go through system memory first.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; also, i know it can be super annoying trying to debug an issue li=
ke<br>
&gt; &gt; this, with someone like me who has all types of differences from =
a<br>
&gt; &gt; normal setup (e.g. using it via egpu, using a kernel with custom<=
br>
&gt; &gt; configs and stuff) so as a token of my appreciation i donated 50$=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just a couple more questions:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - based on what you are aware of, the technical details=
 such as<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shared buffers go through system memory&quot;, an=
d all that, do you see<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any issues that might exist that i might be missing in =
my setup? i<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cant imagine this being the case because the card works=
 great in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; windows, unless the windows driver does something diffe=
rent?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Windows has supported peer to peer DMA for years so it alrea=
dy has a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; numbers of optimizations that are only now becoming possible=
 on Linux.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - as far as kernel config, is there anything in particu=
lar which<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _should_ or _should not_ be enabled/disabled?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You'll need the GPU drivers for your devices and dma-buf sup=
port.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - does the vendor matter? for instance, this is an xfx =
card. when it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes to different vendors, are there interface changes=
 that might<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make one vendor work better for linux than another? i d=
ont really<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand the differences in vendors, but i imagine th=
at the vbios<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differs between vendors, and as such, the linux compati=
bility would<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe change?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; board vendor shouldn't matter.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - is the pcie bandwidth possible an issue? the pcie_bw =
file changes<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between values like this:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 18446683600662707640 18446744071581623085 128<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sometimes i see this:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4096 0 128<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as you can see, the second value seems significantly lo=
wer. is that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possibly an issue? possibly due to aspm?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is to say, its as if the laptop is =
doing everything (e.g. if i<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open a terminal, the terminal will open,=
 but it will take 2 seconds<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for me to see it)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its almost as if all the frames and ever=
ything are being drawn, and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the laptop is running fine and everythin=
g, but i simply just dont get<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see it on the monitor, except for one=
 time every 2 seconds.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its hard to articulate, because its so b=
izarre. its not like, a &quot;low<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fps&quot; per se, because the cursor is =
totally smooth. but its that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _everything else_ is only updated once e=
very couple seconds.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This might also be related to which GPU is th=
e primary.&nbsp; It still may<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be the integrated GPU since that is what is a=
ttached to the laptop<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; panel.&nbsp; Also the platform and some drive=
rs may do certain things when<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the lid is closed.&nbsp; E.g., for thermal re=
asons, the integrated GPU or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPU may have a more limited TDP because the l=
aptop cannot cool as<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; efficiently.<br>
