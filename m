Hi,

I understand the difference between amdgpu and radeon, that's why I was
wondering why those patches would make a difference.

The crash/no-crash behaviour was definitely reproducible - same config
and clean rebuild every time etc. My only guess was that maybe one of the
touched headers got included in the drm-display-helper used by radeon as
well, but that is seemingly not the case either.

In any case, it seems that whatever was going on is fixed in stable-6.6.8-rc1;
at least I haven't been able to reproduce the lockup so far, with various
combinations of display suspend/resume. There's at least one EDID-related patch
in 6.6.8 but I don' understand enough about the various display technologies to
assess whether that could have played a role.

You can probably imagine how frustrating it is to have a GPU that deadlocks while
_not_ doing anything. At least it seems to be working again now, either way.

Thanks for reading!

cheers
Holger
