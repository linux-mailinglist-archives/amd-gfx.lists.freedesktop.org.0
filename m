Sounds good to me! Since a lot of the architecture is the same as the 
Wii and GameCube, maybe once things are working well for Wii U we can 
look at refactoring those out too - a "nintendo" platform? Not a concern 
for now though.

 From the devicetree:

memory {
     device_type = "memory";
     reg = <0x00000000 0x02000000        /* MEM1 - 32MiB */
            0x08000000 0x00300000        /* MEM0 - 3MiB  */
            0x10000000 0x80000000>;      /* MEM2 - 2GiB  */
};

We could probably drop MEM0 without anybody missing it, so let's say a 
256MiB gap between MEM1 and MEM2.
sparsemem does look like a good option, though I note it depends on 
ppc64, so yeah, might be a lot of trouble for the benefit of two 
platforms (Wii and Wii U).
I'm currently attempting to get something baseline running on 5.15, will 
see if the memblock thing still works so I can have a patch for RFC.

Maybe? Looking through head_book3s_32.S that appears to be the case. 
Will probably stick with physaddr 0 for now then.

No problem, will make sure everything is signed off by the people involved.
