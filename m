Hi Mario,

Tested on 7.2-rc2 with your patch applied. The mismatch condition is
unchanged from 6.18.35:

   amdgpu 0000:0b:00.0: VFCT bus number mismatch: table 106 != runtime 11,
       matching by device identity (vendor 0x1002 device 0x1900)
   amdgpu 0000:0b:00.0: Fetched VBIOS from VFCT

Both GPUs initialise fully with your patch.

I also tested 7.2-rc2 without pci=realloc,assign-busses to check whether
the pci/realloc changes fixed the dGPU probe failure. They did not -- the
dGPU still fails on 7.2-rc2:

   amdgpu 0000:03:00.0: Fatal error during GPU init
   amdgpu 0000:03:00.0: probe with driver amdgpu failed with error -12

Without the kernel argument the iGPU sits at its POST bus (0x6A), VFCT
matches directly, and it works fine -- but the dGPU is unusable.
pci=realloc,assign-busses remains necessary for this machine on 7.2-rc2,
which means the VFCT mismatch persists and your patch is still needed.

Thank you for not giving up on me so quickly!
This is my first time working on such issue. It feels
daunting to modify kernel code.

Oz
