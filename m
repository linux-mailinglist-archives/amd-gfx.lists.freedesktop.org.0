Your anecdote of whatever application coincidentally managing to soldier 
through being hung is really not relevant.

The right thing to do is to not break all of our api contracts with the 
application and not egregiously violate the VK and GL specs. :-)

No-one is saying your session should go down.
It looks like Mutter already has some handling for GL robustness anyway...
So this should already just work with these patches if it is not broken?
