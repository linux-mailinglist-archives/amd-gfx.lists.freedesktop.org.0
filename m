It is still definitely possible for an application to do re-create its 
context and hang yet again -- however that is not the problem I am 
trying to solve here.

The problem I am trying to solve is that applications do not even get 
marked guilty when triggering soft recovery right now.

The patch does help with that on SteamOS, as the type of applications we 
deal with that hang, just abort on VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.

If a UI toolkit that handles DEVICE_LOST keeps doing this, then yes it 
would not help, but this patch is also a necessary step towards fixing 
that someday. (Eg. some policy where processes are killed for hanging 
too many times, etc)

No. If said context was entirely unaffected, then it should be 
completely transparent to the application.

Consider the following:

  - I have Counter-Strike 2 running
  - I have Gamescope running

I then go ahead and start HangApp that hangs the GPU.

Soft recovery happens and that clears out all the work for the specific 
VMID for HangApp's submissions and signals the submission fence.

In this instance, the Gamescope and Counter-Strike 2 ctxs are completely 
unaffected and don't need to report VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST as there was no 
impact to their work.

Even if Gamescope or Counter-Strike 2 were occupying CUs in tandem with 
HangApp, FWIU the way that the clear-out works being vmid specific means 
that they would be unaffected, right?
