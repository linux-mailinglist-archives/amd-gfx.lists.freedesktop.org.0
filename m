I think it varies from OEM to OEM and whatever windows required at the
time.  The sbios may also do different things depending on the osi
string passed to ACPI.  Originally, ACPI handled it all directly.
Then we got some laptops which which did the whole event via ATIF
thing (even that I think varied based on the .  Later, I think the
keys just produced brightness events and it was up to the OS to do
something with them so the user's environment would catch the events
and adjust the backlight via the standard OS backlight control
interface.  We never hooked up the ATIF stuff to DC since I don't
recall ever running into any laptops that used it for backlight
control (the code was carried over from radeon when we forked amdgpu).
