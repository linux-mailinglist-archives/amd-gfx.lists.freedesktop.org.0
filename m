Well.  The kernel driver either has no business using long double (or
any other floating point even) at all, or it should know exactly what is
used: double precision, double-double, or quadruple precision.  Both of
the latter two are 128 bits.

Mea culpa, I suppose?  But builddall doesn't force 64 bit explicitly.
I wonder how this happened?  Is it maybe a problem in the powerpc64le
config in GCC itself?  I have a patch from summer last year (Arnd's
toolchains are built without it) that does
+       powerpc64le-*)  TARGET_GCC_CONF=--with-long-double-128
Unfortunately I don't remember why I did that, and I never investigated
what the deeper problem is :-/

In either case, the kernel should always use specific types, not rely on
the toolchain to pick a type that may or may not work.  The correct size
floating point type alone is not enough, but it is a step in the right
direction certainly.
