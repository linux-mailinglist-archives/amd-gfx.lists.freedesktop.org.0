Yes, I double-checked that, and that it returns success.

I've now tested on this Picasso (GFX9) laptop as well. The "Last signaled trailing fence" line is changing here (seems to always match the "Last emitted" line).

However, mutter's frame rate still cannot exceed that of GPU-limited clients. BTW, you can test with a GNOME Wayland session, even without my MR referenced below. Preemption will just be less effective without that MR. mutter has used a high priority context when possible for a long time.

I'm also seeing intermittent freezes, where not even the mouse cursor moves for up to around one second, e.g. when interacting with the GNOME top bar. I'm not sure yet if these are related to this patch series, but I never noticed it before. I wonder if the freezes might occur when GPU preemption is attempted.

Right, but 4c7631800e6b ("drm/amd/amdgpu: add pipe1 hardware support") was for Sienna Cichlid only, and turned out to be unstable, so it had to reverted.

It would be nice to make the SW ring solution take effect by default whenever there is no separate high priority HW gfx queue available (and any other requirements are met).

Even though mutter uses a high priority context via the EGL_IMG_context_priority extension, it's unable to reach a higher frame rate than a GPU-limited client[0]. The "Last preempted" line of /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/amdgpu_fence_info remains at 0x00000000.
