Thank you for the suggestion.  This is something that I should have 
tested from the start.  But I was overly confident that the problem 
could not be a port problem as the hardware is so ancient and the port 
exists for quite a long while and it's currently on the Linux 5.10 level.

But, yes, it is a port problem after all.  I tested Debian with 5.10 
kernel and the problem does not exist there.

Here are some log messages from Linux:

I guess that this tells us that the monitor (DVI-I-2 + DFP2) is detected 
using some other method, so the detection does need to invoke 
radeon_atom_dac_detect for it.

I guess that radeon_dvi_detect() is what is responsible for detecting 
DVI monitor connections.  So, it looks like the difference could be in 
DDC / EDID probing.
