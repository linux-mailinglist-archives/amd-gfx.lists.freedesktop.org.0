We discussed this further on IRC and this is summary of that discussion:

Sima proposed a new type of property that can be used to git feedback to
userspace after atomic ioctl. The user supplies a list of output properties
that they want to query and the kernel fills it in before returning from th=
e
ioctl. This would help to get some information about why things failed
during TEST_ONLY.

Emersion raised the point that you might not know how much memory is needed
beforehand for the returned properties, to which sima replied: blob
property. There was some discussion about how that makes it possible to lea=
k
kernel memory, especially if userspace does not know about a new property
blob. Emersion pointed out that userspace should only request properties
that it understands and pq agreed.

Emersion asked how the user should inform the kernel that it's done with th=
e
blob, to which sima replied: DRM_IOCTL_MODE_DESTROYPROPBLOB. Sima also
mentioned using some sort of weak reference garbage collection scheme for
properties and there was some further discussion, but I'm not sure there wa=
s
any conclusion.

I asked if it made sense to add color format capabilities to the mode info
struct, but the conclusion was that it wouldn't really be useful because we
need TEST_ONLY anyway to see if the color format setting is compatible with
other settings.

I asked again if we should drop the "active color format" property as it
seems to be more trouble than it's worth for now. pq mentioned that there
are 2 separate use cases (in his words):
- People playing with setting UI would like to know what "auto" would resul=
t
  in, but that's just nice to have
- The other use case is the flicker-free boot into known configuration He
  went on to point out that the main problem with "auto" is that any modese=
t
  could make the driver decide differently. This means that we cannot fully
  rely on the previously set property.

However, leaving out "active color property" did not put us in a worse
situation than before, so the conclusion was that we should leave it out fo=
r
now. For GUI selectors, the current TEST_ONLY should be good enough, and al=
l
the fancy stuff discussed previously isn't needed for now.

To summarise the summary: this means that we will drop the "active
color format" property and rename the "preferred color format"
property to "force color format" or just "color format" and failing to
satisfy that constraint will fail the modeset rather than falling back
to the "auto" behaviour.

Cheers,
Andri
