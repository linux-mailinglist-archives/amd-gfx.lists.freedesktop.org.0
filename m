There was a bit of unexpected fallout from the atomic-only conversion
patches that I had pushed a while ago, which mostly affected amdgpu.
This fixes most of the severe issues, although we're still investigating
some lingering issues (which I suspect may just fix themselves following
this patchset, but we'll see!).

This is -technically- a v2 as it's a continuation on this previous
series:

https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/110556/

and there were some rather important changes made since then that Wayne
pointed out, which may or may not fix the last few issues left on this
issue:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2171

Note I've omitted one KASAN fix, but that's because it was just getting
in the way of turning on KASAN and was definitely unrelated to this bug.
Will submit that one on it's own shortly.
