No, no and no. Aside from introducing issues by side effects not 
surfacing and all of the stuff I mentioned about descriptor buffers, 
bda, draw indirect and stuff just resulting in more faults and hangs...

You are proposing we throw out every promise we made to an application 
on the API contract level because it "might work". That's just wrong!

Let me put this in explicit terms: What you are proposing is in direct 
violation of the GL and Vulkan specification.

You can't just chose to break these contracts because you think it 
'might' be a better user experience.

The correct thing for GNOME/Mutter to do is to simply re-create it's 
context, reimport it's DMABUFs, etc.

The fact that it survives and keeps soldiering on with whatever side 
effects missed is purely coincidental and not valid API usage.

If you want such behaviour for hangs for Mutter, you should propose a 
GL/VK extension for it, but I really doubt that will get anywhere.
