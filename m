Exactly that doesn't work.

See the set_q_mode handling works by looking at the next job in the queue and determining based in PM4 code if executing the packet is necessary or not.

When we drop some jobs from execution because they belong to the same context as the one who caused the timeout we write incorrect commands into the PM4 stream when re-emitting.

We would need to extend the handling in a way where we can say ok this job is now skipped, but we need to pretend that it isn't so that the set_q_mode handling works and then still not execute the IBs in the job.

Long story short that is seriously not going to work. So absolutely clear NAK from my side to this approach.

What we could do to avoid problems and patching pointers in the command stream is to emit only the fence signaling for skipped jobs and fill everything else with NOPs.

Christian.
