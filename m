Well never said that this would be easy. It just seems to be the most 
doable solution.

You need the prange->lock for the state management of the prange object, 
but that should essentially be separated from the PTEs.

But I would go as far as saying that with recoverable page faults we 
don't need the status in the range any more.

We just update the PTEs based on the invalidation requests and page 
faults. The range would then just be used to check the validity of page 
faults.

And I'm pretty sure exactly that won't work. We need to serialize all 
PTE updates, otherwise you end up in hell again when you free a range 
and immediately allocate a new one at the same location.
