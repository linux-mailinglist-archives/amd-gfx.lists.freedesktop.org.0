I won't comment on this because it's irrelevant. Alex will decide which
pull request it will end up in.

This is format(bpp)-independent. If some formats don't support some
alignment, only modifiers that are supported by all formats should be
exposed.

Drivers should list the alignment they support and all greater ones, e.g.:
Intel: 64B, 128B, 256B
AMD: 256B

Nobody chooses exactly which modifier to use in advance, and if some app
did that, it would be a violation of how modifiers work. Drivers only
expose modifiers sorted from best to worst, apps only compute intersections
of modifier lists and pass them to drivers, and drivers pick the first one
in the list or the best one in the list, but it doesn't matter which one at
that point. The computation of the intersection is what determines which
modifiers are allowed.

Yes and no. Apps should never get an image using LINEAR if PITCH_ALIGN is
first in the list.

If we did that, it would be an admission that using modifiers exposed by
drivers can fail image allocation for any reason, and thus it would be an
indication that modifiers are a badly designed API because driver-exposed
modifiers don't fully describe image layouts, which is what they were
supposed to do in the first place.
