When running the driver on a SR-IOV virtual function (VF), some
registers are not available directly via the VF's MMIO aperture so
they need to go through the RLC.  For bare metal or passthrough this
is not relevant.

Yes.

Typo in the ip discovery table on renoir.

In general, barring typos, the code is shared at the major version
level.  The actual code may or may not need changes to handle minor
revision changes in an IP.  The driver maps the IP versions from the
ip discovery table to the code contained in the driver.

These registers are just mailboxes for the PSP firmware.  All of the
C2PMSG registers functionality is defined by the PSP firmware.  They
are basically scratch registers used to communicate between the driver
and the PSP firmware.

On APUs, the PSP is shared with the CPU so the PSP firmware is part of
the sbios image.  The driver doesn't load it.  We only load it on
dGPUs where the driver is responsible for the chip initialization.

We looked into this a bit ourselves and ran into the same issues.
We'd probably need to debug this with the PSP team to make further
progress, but this was not productized so neither team had the
resources to delve further.
