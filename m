im using Driver "amdgpu" in my xorg conf

how does one verify which gpu is the primary? im assuming my intel
card is the primary, since i have not done anything to change that.

also, if all shared buffers have to go through system memory, then
that means an eGPU amdgpu wont work very well in general right?
because going through system memory for the egpu means going over the
thunderbolt connection

and what are the shared buffers youre referring to? for example, if an
application is drawing to a buffer, is that an example of a shared
buffer that has to go through system memory? if so, thats fine, right?
because the application's memory is in system memory, so that copy
wouldnt be an issue.

in general, do you think the "copy buffer across system memory might
be a hindrance for thunderbolt? im trying to figure out which
directions to go to debug and im totally lost, so maybe i can do some
testing that direction?

and for what its worth, when i turn the display "off" via the gnome
display settings, its the same issue as when the laptop lid is closed,
so unless the motherboard reads the "closed lid" the same as "display
off", then im not sure if its thermal issues.
