We can easily detect if the timestamp is going backwards and so filter 
out stale entries.

I think trying to solve that with the IH code or hardware is the 
completely wrong approach.

As I said before we need to something more robust and using the 
timestamp sounds like the most logical approach to me.

The only alternative I can see would be to have a hardware assisted flag 
which tells you if you had an overflow or not like we have for IH ring 0.

E.g. something like the following:
1. Copy the next N IV from the RPTR location.
2. Get the current WPTR.
3. If the overflow bit in the WPTR is set update the RPTR to something 
like WPTR+window, clear the overflow bit and repeat at #1.
4. Process the valid IVs.

The down side is that we are loosing a lot of IVs with that. That is 
probably ok for the current approach, but most likely a bad idea if we 
enable the CAM.

Regards,
Christian.
