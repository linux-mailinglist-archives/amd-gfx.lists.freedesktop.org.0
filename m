Sure.  The driver has always had upper bound limits for overclocking,
this change adds lower bounds checking for underclocking as well.
When the silicon validation teams set the bounding box for a device,
they set a range of values where it's reasonable to operate based on
the characteristics of the design.

If we did want to allow extended underclocking, we need a big warning
in the logs at the very least.
