I'm afraid linear _is_ special. And we've never had a delineation
between 'applications' and 'clients' for uAPI purposes; I mean, if
it's OK for Mesa and AMDVLK and ROCm to know exactly how to deal with
AMD tiling modes for HIC, why is it not OK for apps to know that
themselves too? Mostly because it's immaterial to the kernel: if it
breaks one, it's going to break the other too.

Yes, but it's _not_ a misuse of the API for the app to query supported
modifiers, see that LINEAR is supported, know that its input is linear
(because it created it, or because the subsystem it gets it from only
supports linear layouts, or because they have another flag for linear
with a non-modifier API, or), and use LINEAR with that. That's exactly
what happens for anyone who wants to do interop with e.g. V4L2.

You're extrapolating way too far. Linear works totally fine for
everyone except AMD. The special case is that it doesn't work on AMD
because AMD imposes really weird constraints.

LINEAR cannot be removed any time soon/ever. You'd have to change all
the clients who clearly and correctly use it without breaking the
rules today, wait for them to phase out, wait to make sure that no-one
would have them in an old container image or want to bisect into them,
and only then kill it.

Cheers,
Daniel
