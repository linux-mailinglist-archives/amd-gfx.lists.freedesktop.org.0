Hello everyone,

patch by user @fililip was posted there, but not submitted:

/"I think I'd have to submit it to the linux kernel mailing list, which 
I am kinda scared of ðŸ˜…. It could be better to submit that patch to Arch 
Linux maintainers; they could include it in their kernel builds."/

Implementation of this patch can be simplified by simply setting:

|smu->min_power_limit = amdgpu_ignore_min_pcap ? 0 : 
whatever_default_smuxx;|

and then leave rest of the code unchanged(except defining 
|amdgpu_ignore_min_pcap |variable of course). Nothing tricky nor need to 
revert anything should be needed I hope. Please add it to the general 
kernel as an option, it certainly should not be related to Archlinux only.

Roman

Haven't seen any statement from the amdgpu developers (now CCed) yet on
this there (but might have missed something!). From what I can see I
assume this will likely be somewhat tricky to handle, as a revert
overall might be a bad idea here. We'll see I guess.

Roman posted something that apparently was meant to go to the list, so
let me put it here:
