&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Hello Kernel, AMD GPU, &amp; ROCm maintainers,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; TL;DR: My Polaris (RX-580, gfx803) freezes under compute load on a=
 number of kernels since v6.14 and newer. This was not previously the case =
prior to 6.15 for ROCm 6.4.0 on gfx803 cards.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The issue has been successfully mitigated within an older version =
of ROC under kernel 6.16rc2 by reverting two specific commits:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; de84484c6f8b (=E2=80=9Cdrm/amdkfd: Improve signal event slow path=
=E2=80=9D, 2024-12-19)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; bac38ca057fe (=E2=80=9Cdrm/amdkfd: implement per queue sdma reset =
for gfx 9.4+=E2=80=9D, 2025-03-06)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Reverting both commits on top of v6.16-rc3 restores full stability=
 and allows ROCm 5.7 workloads (e.g., Stable-Diffusion, faster-whisper) to =
run. Instability is usually immediately obvious via eg models failing to in=
itialise, no errors (other than host dmesg)/segfault reported, which is the=
 usual failure method under previous kernels.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ________________________________<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Problem Description<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; A number of users report GPU hangs when initialising compute loads=
, specifically with ROCm 5.7+ workloads. This issue appears to be a regress=
ion, as it was not present in earlier kernel versions.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; System Information:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; OS: Arch Linux<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; GPU: AMD Radeon RX 580 Series (gfx803)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ROCm Version: Runtime Version: 1.1, Runtime Ext Version: 1.7 (as p=
er rocminfo --support)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ________________________________<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Affected Kernels and Regression Details<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The problem consistently occurs on v6.14.1-rc1 and newer kernels.<=
br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Last known good: v6.11<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; First known bad: v6.12<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The regression has been bisected to the following two commits, as =
reverting them resolves the issue:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; de84484c6f8b (=E2=80=9Cdrm/amdkfd: Improve signal event slow path=
=E2=80=9D, 2024-12-19)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; bac38ca057fe (=E2=80=9Cdrm/amdkfd: implement per queue sdma reset =
=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D, 2025-03-06)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Both patches touch amdkfd queue reset paths and are first included=
 in the exact releases where the regression appears.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s a summary of kernel results:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Kernel | Result | Note<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ------- | -------- | --------<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 6.13.y (LTS) | OK |<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 6.14.0 | OK | Baseline - my last working kernel, though I am not e=
xactly sure which subver<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 6.14.1-rc1 | BAD | First hang<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 6.15-rc1 | BAD | Hang<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 6.15.8 | BAD | Hang<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 6.16-rc3 | BAD | Hang<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 6.16-rc3 =E2=80=93 revert de84484 + bac38ca | OK | Full stability =
restored, ROCm workloads run for hours.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ________________________________<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Reproduction Steps<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Boot the system with a kernel version exhibiting the issue (e.g., =
v6.14.1-rc1 or newer without the reverts).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Run a ROCm workload that creates several compute queues, for examp=
le:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; python stable-diffusion.py<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; faster-whisper --model medium ...<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Upon model initialization, an immediate driver crash occurs. This =
is visible on the host machine via dmesg logs.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Observed Error Messages (dmesg):<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; [drm] scheduler comp_1.1.1 is not ready, skipping<br>
&gt;&gt; [drm:sched_job_timedout] ERROR ring comp_1.1.1 timeout<br>
&gt;&gt; [message continues ad-infinitum while system functions generally]<=
br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; This is followed by a hard GPU reset (visible in logs, no visual a=
rtifacts), which reliably leads to a full system lockup. Python or Docker p=
rocesses become unkillable, requiring a manual reboot. Over time, the deskt=
op slowly loses interactivity.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ________________________________<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Bisect Details<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I previously attempted a git bisect (limited to drivers/gpu/drm/am=
d) between v6.12 and v6.15-rc1, which identified some further potentially p=
roblematic commits, however due to undersized /boot/ partition was experien=
cing some difficulties. In the interim, it seems a user on=C2=A0 the gfx803=
 compatibilty repo discovered the below regarding ROC 5.7:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; de84484c6f8b07ad0850d6c4=C2=A0 bad<br>
&gt;&gt; bac38ca057fef2c8c024fe9e=C2=A0 bad<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Cherry-picking reverts of both commits on top of v6.16-rc3 restore=
s normal behavior; leaving either patch in place reproduces the hang.<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ________________________________<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Why this matters<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Although gfx803 is End-of-Life (EOL) for official ROCm support, la=
rge user communities (Stable-Diffusion, Whisper, Tinygrad) still depend on =
it. Community builds (e.g., <a href=3D"http://github.com/robertrosenbusch/g=
fx803_rocm/" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">github.com/robertrosenbus=
ch/gfx803_rocm/</a>) demonstrate that ROCm 6.4+ and RX-580 are fully functi=
onal on a number of relatively recent kernels. This regression significantl=
y impacts the usability of these cards for compute workloads.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ________________________________<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Proposed Next Steps<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I suggest the following for further investigation:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Review the interaction between the new KFD signal-event slow-path =
and legacy GPUs that may lack valid event IDs.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Confirm whether hqd_sdma_get_doorbell() logic (added in bac38ca) r=
eturns stale doorbells on gfx803, potentially causing false positives.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Consider back-outs for 6.15-stable / 6.16-rc while a proper fix is=
 developed.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Please let me know if you require any further diagnostics or testi=
ng. I can easily rebuild kernels and provide annotated traces.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
