Low clocks can be an issue even for normal desktop workloads, so doubtful that this would be a complete solution.

Maybe the firmware power management heuristics could be derived from the system power profile and fence deadline? E.g. the power profile defines the upper and lower boundaries, the upper boundary is used while there's a pending fence deadline, otherwise the lower boundary.
