drm/arm is the arm display driver, which isn't actually shipping
anywhere afaik. Also it's not including the hdmi/dp output drivers,
those are generally external on socs, but integrated in discrete gpu.

The other thing to keep in mind is that one of these drivers supports
25 years of product generations, and the other one doesn't. So I think
adding it all up it's not that much different. Last time I looked if
you look at just command submission and rendering/compute, and not
include display, which heavily skews the stats, it's about 10% kernel,
90% userspace driver parts. Not including anything that's shared,
which is most of it (compiler frontend, intermediate optimizer, entire
runtime/state tracker and all the integration and glue pieces
largely).

AMD is 3 million lines the size because it includes per-generation
generated header files.

And of course once you throw an entire vendor team at a driver all
those engineers will produce something, and there's the usual that the
last 10% of features produce about 90% of the complexity and code
problem. E.g. the kbase driver for arm mali gpu is 20x the size of the
in-tree panfrost driver - they need to keep typing to justify their
continued employement, or something like that. Usually it's because
they reinvent the world.

Not sure where this got lost, but we're totally fine with vendors
using the upstream driver together with their closed stack. And most
of the drivers we do have in upstream are actually, at least in parts,
supported by the vendor. E.g. if you'd have looked the drm/arm driver
you picked is actually 100% written by ARM engineers. So kinda
unfitting example.

Nvidia has been claiming to try and sort out the FW problem for years.
They even managed to release a few things, but I think the last one is
2-3 years late now. Partially the reason is that there don't have a
stable api between the firmware and driver, it's all internal from the
same source tree, and they don't really want to change that.

Well I guess someone could stand up a drivers/totally-not-gpu and just
let the flood in. Even duplicated drivers and everything included,
because the vendor drivers are better. Worth a shot, we've practically
started this already, I'm just not going to help with the cleanup.

Agreed. We actually got them in-tree largely. Nvidia even contributes
the oddball thing, and I think the tegra line is still fully supported
in upstream with the upstream driver.

I'm not sure the bleak picture you're drawing is reality, aside from
the fact that Nvidia discrete gpu drivers being a disaster with no
redistributable firmware, no open kernel driver that works, and
nothing else really either.

Not sure which one you mean, but every once in a while they open up a
few headers, or a few programming specs, or a small driver somewhere
for a very specific thing, and then it dies again or gets obfuscated
for the next platform, or just never updated. I've never seen anything
that comes remotely to something complete, aside from tegra socs,
which are fully supported in upstream afaik.
