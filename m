I would say something like:

The CP (Command Processor) is the front end to the GC hardware.  It
provides microcontrollers which manage command queues which are used
to feed jobs to the GFX and compute hardware.

The driver/developers don't interact with CPF, CPC, CPG directly.
They just happen to be arbitrary sub-blocks of the CP.  I'm concerned
that adding a lot of stuff about them will just lead to confusion.

Documenting the micro controllers which run the firmwares makes sense
as those are how the driver interacts with the CP block.

CE/PFP/ME - Microcontrollers which run the firmware that provides the
graphics command queues that the driver interacts with.
MEC - Microcontrollers which run the firmware that provides the
compute command queues that the driver interacts with.
MES - Microcontrollers which run the firmware that provides the
command queues that the driver uses to manage graphics and compute
command queues.
