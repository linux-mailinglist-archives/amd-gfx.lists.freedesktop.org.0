SI didn't have SDMA.  It used the older paging and DMA engine.
SDMA 2.x used byte_count directly in the packet so the limit is 0x1fffff
SDMA 3.x used byte_count directly in the packet so the limit is
0x3fffe0 or 0x3fff00 depending on alignment.
SDMA 4.0.x used byte_count -1 in the packet so the limit is 0x400000.
SDMA 4.4.x used byte_count -1 in the packet and increased the limit to
0x4000000.
SDMA 5.0.x used byte_count -1 in the packet so the limit is 0x400000.
SDMA 5.2.x and newer used byte_count -1 in the packet and increased
the limit to 0x4000000.
