No, I'm proposing to completely abandon the concept of guilty contexts. 
Basically what we should do is to return an error from the CS IOCTL 
whenever a previous submission resulted in a fatal error as suggested by 
Marek.

That we query the context for guilty was just a design decision we 
copied over from our closed source drivers which turned out to 
absolutely not solving anything.

Marek can probably comment as well why the whole idea of querying the 
kernel if something fatal happens instead of just rejecting submissions 
is broken by design.

Ok, well then I now have two people (Marek and you) saying that soft 
recovery should be fatal while Michel is saying that soft recovery being 
non fatal improves stability for him :)

Should we somehow make that configurable or depend it on if that's the 
display server or if it's an user application?

Christian.
