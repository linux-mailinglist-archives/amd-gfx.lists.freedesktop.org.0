Given it's not a 100% reproduce for you, how did you confirm this commit 
is causing the issue?  Some sort of sampling of X cycles at each bisect 
point?

Could you capture a dmesg log where /sys/power/pm_debug_messages is set 
both from a good case and from a bad case so we can compare?

The peculiar thing is this commit only changes the timing of some of the 
suspend sequence, and as part of the suspend sequence the GPU is reset 
anyway.  So during the resume sequence it shouldn't have mattered what 
happened the last time on suspend entry.

Thanks,
