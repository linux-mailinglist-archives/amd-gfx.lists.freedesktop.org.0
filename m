Safe as is whether it has potential to swallow a legitimate unseen faults.

Looking at amdgpu_gmc_filter_faults() a bit lower down, it does appear 
to filter out repeated faults on the same address. Would it be safe to 
rely on that instead of the timestamp equality check?

I appreciate that may cause a transient interrupt handling storm if the 
clock granularity is poor, but maybe that is better than losing a fault.

I guess if the equality filter can be removed then this concern also 
goes away.
