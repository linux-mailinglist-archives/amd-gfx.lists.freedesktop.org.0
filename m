Let's try to shed some more light on how things work, taking as excuse
psp_v12_0_ring_create().

First, register access through [RW]REG32_SOC15() is implemented in
terms of __[RW]REG32_SOC15_RLC__(), which is basically a [RW]REG32(),
except it has to be more complex in the SR-IOV case.
Has the RLC anything to do with SR-IOV ?

It accesses registers in the MMIO range of the MP0 IP, and the "MP0"
name correlates highly with MMIO accesses in PSP-handling code.
Is "MP0" another name for PSP (and "MP1" for SMU) ?  The MP0 version
reported at v11.0.3 by discovery seems to contradict the use of v12.0
for RENOIR as set by soc15_set_ip_blocks(), or do I miss something ?

More generally (and mostly out of curiosity while we're at it), do we
have a way to match IPs listed at discovery time with the ones used
in the driver ?

---

As for the register names, maybe we could have a short explanation of
how they are structured ?  Eg. mmMP0_SMN_C2PMSG_69: that seems to be
a MMIO register named "C2PMSG_69" in the "MP0" IP, but I'm not sure
of the "SMN" part -- that could refer to the "System Management Network",
described in [0] as an internal bus.  Are we accessing this register
through this SMN ?

Trying to understand in more details how we start the PSP up, I noticed
that psp_v12_0 has support for loading a sOS firmware, but never calls
init_sos_microcode() - and anyway there is no sos firmware for renoir
and green_sardine, which seem to be the only ASICs with this PSP version.
Is it something that's just not been completely wired up yet ?

That also rings a bell, that we have nothing about Secure OS in the doc
yet (not even the acronym in the glossary).

I can see a single case in the PSP code where GTT is used instead of
vram: to create fw_pri_bo when SR-IOV is not used (and there has
to be a reason, since the SR-IOV code path does use vram).
Changing it to vram does not make a difference, but then the
only bo that seems to be used at that point is the one for the psp ring,
which is allocated in vram, so I'm not too much surprised.

Maybe I should double-check bo_create calls to hunt for more ?
