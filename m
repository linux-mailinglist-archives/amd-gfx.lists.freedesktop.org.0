Hi,

might be a dumb question because I'm not too familiar with
MEMORY_DEVICE_COHERENT, but who's in charge of migrating *to* that
memory? Or how does a process ever get a grab on such pages?

And where does migration come into play? I assume migration is only
required to migrate off of that device memory to ordinary system RAM
when required because the device memory has to be freed up, correct?

(a high level description on how this is exploited from users space
would be great)
