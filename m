Yeah with all other modifiers pitch alignment or other alignment/sizing
requirements are generally implied. Mostly by stuff like tile size, but
there's others where the hw requirement flat out is that the buffer must
have a power-of-two stride (and maybe we should document these when they
pop up, but the only one I know of are the legacy i915 modifiers, which
are kinda busted anyway for interop).

For that reason I think linear modifiers with explicit pitch/size
alignment constraints is a sound concept and fits into how modifiers work
overall.
