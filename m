Hi Alex, how can I bribe you to start placing "Link:" tags in
submissions that fix regressions (like this one), as explained in the
Linux kernels documentation (see
'Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst' and
'Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst'). E.g. in this case like this:

"Link:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220403132322.51c90903@darkstar.example.org/"

This concept is not new (Linus and quite a few other developers use them
like this for a long time), I just recently improved those documents to
clarify things, as my regression tracking efforts rely on them -- that's
why it's making my work a lot harder if they are missing most of the
time. :-/

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
