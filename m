I looked at this question, and at least for PMD, mmap_sem is not
sufficient. I didn't easilly figure it out for the other ones

I'm guessing if PMD is not safe then none of them are.

The reason I ask is because hmm's walkers often have this pattern
where they get the pointer and then de-ref it (again) then
immediately have to recheck the 'again' conditions of the walker
itself because the re-read may have given a different value.

Having the walker deref the pointer and pass the value it into the ops
for use rather than repeatedly de-refing an unlocked value seems like
a much safer design to me.

If this also implicitly relies on a RCU grace period then it is also
missing RCU locking...

I also didn't quite understand why walk_pte_range() skipped locking
the pte in the no_vma case - I don't get why vma would be related to
locking here.

I also saw that hmm open coded the pte walk, presumably for
performance, so I was thinking of adding some kind of pte_range()
callback to avoid the expensive indirect function call per pte, but
hmm also can't have the pmd locked...
