You can ignore the patch 1/3, it just changes memory management test 
suite.

Everyone else does seem fine because they don't use periodic signals :-)

OpenCL is not the first thing that got broken by periodic signals. In the 
past, I found bugs in Linux/alpha, Linux/hppa, Cygwin, Intel Software 
Developer's Emulator regarding periodic signals. fork() was also buggy and 
it was fixed by c3ad2c3b02e953ead2b8d52a0c9e70312930c3d0.

Do you have any userspace application that expects open("/dev/kfd") to be 
interrupted with -EINTR and breaks when it isn't?

This call path is also triggered by -EINTR from mm_take_all_locks: 
"init_user_pages -> amdgpu_hmm_register -> mmu_interval_notifier_insert -> 
mmu_notifier_register -> __mmu_notifier_register -> mm_take_all_locks -> 
return -EINTR". I am not expert in the GPU code, so I don't know how much 
serious it is.

No - the kernel should do what applications expect. open is (according to 
the man page) supposed to be interrupted when opening slow devices (for 
example fifo). I'm wondering whether /dev/kfd should be considered a slow 
device or not.

The AMDGPU OpenCL implementation attempts to open /dev/kfd and if it gets 
-EINTR, it behaves as if OpenCL were unavailable - it won't report itself 
in clGetPlatformIDs and it will make clGetDeviceIDs fail.

So, we are dealing with random failures - any single signal received at 
wrong time can make OpenCL fail.

Even if I disabled the periodic timer, the failure could be triggered by 
other signals, for example SIGWINCH when the user resizes the terminal, or 
SIGCHLD when a subprocess exits.

In practice, I use 10ms timer and I get occasional OpenCL failures. In the 
test example, I used 50us timer, so that it is reproduced reliably - but 
decreasing the timer frequency doesn't fix the failure, it just makes it 
happen less often.
