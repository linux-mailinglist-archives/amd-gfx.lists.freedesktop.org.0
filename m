Yes, I'd go with absolute units when it comes to memory, because it's
not a renewable resource like CPU and IO, and so we do have cliff
behavior around the edge where you transition from ok to not-enough.

memory.low is a bit in flux right now, so if anything is unclear
around its semantics, please feel free to reach out.
