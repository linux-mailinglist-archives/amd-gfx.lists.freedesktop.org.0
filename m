Hello,

Back to reading some amdgpu code, I stumbled on a few things that probably =
ought
to be added to the glossary.  Well, to be fair, I actually just had to read=
 the kernel
logs to see most of them, so those likely make sense to explain.

* ATPX (could not find anything about that on the net). "PX" alone seems to=
 be used=20
  as a synonym.  Referred to as "ATPX power control", and closely linked to=
 vga_switcheroo.
  This seems to be a preferred alternative to
  BOCO and BACO, but those are only tersely mentioned in the glossary, and =
could maybe
  use more details.  There also seem to be the notion of "ATPX hybrid" (whi=
ch apparently
  applies to the RENOIR in my laptop)
* MACO and BAMACO looks similarly related (I may have missed some ;)
* CRAT seems to be known as "Component Resource Attribute Table" ACPI table=
 according
  to various Internet sources (it is listed as "Component Resource Associat=
ion Table"
  in kfd_crat.h, do we want to adjust this?), but I could not locate any de=
tails on this
  table (ACPI 6.5 seems to list it as deprecated, but even 6.4 just gives e=
rroneous
  information, "Links to ACPI-related Documents" in=E3=80=80https://uefi.or=
g/acpi has no info)
  Is it useful to add to the glossary, with some info about its role in the=
 amdgpu context?


Now about the init on my MSI Bravo17 (Renoir APU, Navi10 dGPU)...

What I understand about ATPX is that this is a "PX system", as shown by amd=
gpu_atpx_detect()
logging:
 amdgpu: vga_switcheroo: detected switching method \_SB_.PCI0.GP17.VGA_.ATP=
X handle

So amdgpu seems to imply vga_switcheroo is supposed to get initialized at s=
ome point, right?
Similarly with another similar-looking log:

 snd_hda_intel 0000:03:00.1: Handle vga_switcheroo audio client

But no other log see vga_switcheroo actually getting enabled (and the debug=
fs dir does not
appear either, confirming this).

That is, no call to vga_switcheroo_enable() gets done (both would trigger a
"vga_switcheroo: enabled" log).  The 2 call chains from amdgpu would be:

amdgpu_init()
-> amdgpu_register_atpx_handler()
   -> vga_switcheroo_register_handler()

amdgpu_device_init()
-> vga_switcheroo_register_client()
   -> register_client()

Booting with "tp_printk ftrace=3Dfunction ftrace_filter=3Dvga_switcheroo_re=
gister_handler,vga_switcheroo_register_client,vga_switcheroo_ready" it gets=
 obvious vga_switcheroo_register_client() never not gets called.

The answer seems to lie in amdgpu_device_supports_px(), but I'm not sure to=
 get everything straight here:
amdgpu_device_supports_px() is documented as "Returns true if the device is=
 a dGPU with ATPX power control",
but amdgpu_is_atpx_hybrid() it calls seems to take info from a single stati=
c struct, so does the quoted
docstring really make sense?  And if an "APTX hybrid" system does not suppo=
rt vga_switcheroo in the end,
couldn't we just avoid any mention of vga_switcheroo in the logs (since it =
is indeed amdgpu itself sending
the user on that track), or at least just print once that it is not support=
ed and a short reason?

Best regards,
--=20
Yann
