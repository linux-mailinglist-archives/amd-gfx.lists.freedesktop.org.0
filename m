ddab8bd788f5 ("drm/amd/display: Fix two cursor duplication when using overl=
ay")
is the commit which introduced the validate_overlay logic fixing ChromeOS a=
nd
breaking gamescope.

Later, 33f409e60eb0 ("drm/amd/display: Fix overlay validation by considerin=
g
cursors") relaxed validate_overlay. This breaks ChromeOS and partially fixe=
s
gamescope (when the overlay is used and the cursor plane is unused).

Finally, e7d9560aeae5 ("Revert "drm/amd/display: Fix overlay validation by
considering cursors"") has reverted that change, fixing ChromeOS (again) an=
d
breaking gamescope completely again.

I've tried to explain the full story above. My user-space went from working=
 to
broken to partially broken to broken. The quoted reply is a complaint that =
the
commit flipped gamescope from partially broken to completely broken. At the
time I didn't realize that ddab8bd788f5 caused some pain too.

Does that clear things up?
