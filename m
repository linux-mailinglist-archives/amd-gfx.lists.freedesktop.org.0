Yes, that shouldn't be an issue as the kobject embedded in a kset is
ONLY for that kset itself, the kset structure should not be controling
the lifespan of the object it is embedded in, right?

Note, the use of ksets by a device driver like you are doing here in the
amd driver is BROKEN and will cause problems by userspace tools.  Don't
do that please, just use a single subdirectory for an attribute.  Doing
deeper stuff like this is sure to cause problems and be a headache.
