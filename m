To be clear your understanding -

Nothing is automatic in PMFW. PMFW picks a priority based on the actual 
mask sent by driver.

Assuming lower bits corresponds to highest priority -

If driver sends a mask with Bit3 and Bit 0 set, PMFW will chose profile 
that corresponds to Bit0. If driver sends a mask with Bit4 Bit2 set and 
rest unset, PMFW will chose profile that corresponds to Bit2. However if 
driver sends a mask only with a single bit set, it chooses the profile 
regardless of whatever was the previous profile. t doesn't check if the 
existing profile > newly requested one. That is the behavior.

So if a job send chooses a profile that corresponds to Bit0, driver will 
send that. Next time if another job chooses a profile that corresponds 
to Bit1, PMFW will receive that as the new profile and switch to that. 
It trusts the driver to send the proper workload mask.

Hope that gives the picture.

Thanks,
Lijo
