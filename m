The Gallium HUD doesn't consume strings. It only consumes values that are
exposed as counters from the driver. In this case, we need the driver to
expose evicted stats as counters. Each counter can set whether the value is
absolute (e.g. memory usage) or monotonic (e.g. perf counter). Parsing
fdinfo to get the values is undesirable.

                            Well the main question is what are you
                            trying to get from that information? The
                            eviction list for example is completely
                            meaningless to userspace, that stuff is only
                            temporary and will be cleared on the next CS
                            again.<br>

                        <div>I don&#39;t know what you mean. The returned
                          eviction stats look correct and are stable
                          (they don&#39;t change much). You can suggest
                          changes if you think some numbers are not
                          reported correctly.<br>

                            What we could expose is the VRAM over-commit
                            value, e.g. how much BOs which where
                            supposed to be in VRAM are in GTT now. I
                            think that&#39;s what you are looking for here,

                            Well I see the reasoning for that, but I
                            also see why other drivers do a lot of the
                            stuff we have as IOCTL as separate files in
                            sysfs, fdinfo or debugfs.<br>
                            <br>
                            Especially repeating all the static
                            information which were already available
                            under sysfs in the INFO IOCTL was a design
                            mistake as far as I can see. Just compare
                            what AMDGPU and the KFD code is doing to
                            what for example i915 is doing.<br>
                            <br>
                            Same for things like debug information about
                            a process. The fdinfo stuff can be queried
                            from external tools (gdb, gputop, umr
                            etc...) as well which makes that interface
                            more preferred.<br>

                  That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking: Is this for some tool or =
to
                  make some driver decision based on it?<br>
                  <br>
                  If you just want the numbers for over displaying then
                  I think it would be better to put this into fdinfo
                  together with the other existing stuff there.<br>

                  If you want to make allocation decisions based on this
                  then we should have that as IOCTL or even better as
                  mmap() page between kernel and userspace. But in this
                  case I would also calculation the numbers completely
                  different as well.<br>
                  <br>
                  See we have at least the following things in the
                  kernel:<br>
                  1. The eviction list in the VM.<br>
                  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Those are the BOs which are currently =
evicted and
                  tried to moved back in on the next CS.<br>
                  <br>
                  2. The VRAM over commit value.<br>
                  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 In other words how much more VRAM than=
 available
                  has the application tried to allocate?<br>
                  <br>
                  3. The visible VRAM usage by this application.<br>
                  <br>
                  The end goal is that the eviction list will go away,
                  e.g. we will always have stable allocations based on
                  allocations of other applications and not constantly
                  swap things in and out.<br>
                  <br>
                  When you now expose the eviction list to userspace we
                  will be stuck with this interface forever.<br>

                All lists are treated equally, and mem_type is compared
                with preferred_domains to determine where buffers are
                and where they should be.<br>
