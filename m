Hi Christian,

Thanks for the reply.

Right now, I've got it hooked up to a Corsair VX550W. It's on a test bench 
so the only things hanging off the mobo at the moment are the GPU and a 
pair of NVMe drives.

I'm also testing this system with a RTX 2060 Super and I have no problems 
with that card, even under heavy load.

I'm not even trying for a desktop yet, it's currently booting to runlevel 3 :-)

As mentioned above, the 2060 does just fine and its power needs are 
significantly higher than that of the 6500.

It's possible that it's something with my particular motherboard. Michael 
Larabel over at Phoronix did some performance testing[1] with this same 
model card running on Ubuntu 22.04, seemingly without problem.

Do you have any suggestions for further troubleshooting?

Thanks,
