At some point the pages under the buffer have to be either pinned
or protected by mmu notifier. So each and every single device doing
DMA to these pages must either pin, or use mmu notifier.

Driver A should never 'borrow' a notifier from B

If each driver controls its own lifetime of the buffers, why can't the
driver locally wait for its device to finish?

Can't the GPUs cancel work that is waiting on a DMA fence? Ie if
Driver A detects that work completed and wants to trigger a DMA fence,
but it now knows the buffer is invalidated, can't it tell driver B to
give up?

But why does this matter? Does the GPU itself consume some work and
then stall internally waiting for an external DMA fence?

Otherwise I would expect this dependency chain should be breakable by
aborting work waiting on fences upon invalidation (without stalling)

Fair enough
