Yeah, I mean we had a similar outcry when we started to apply the limits 
for the display PLLs as well.

It's just that we have to stay inside certain parameters to be allowed 
as hardware vendor to sell the stuff in most countries because of public 
regulations.

I mean you can in theory program the ASIC so that it starts sucking more 
power than allowed through the PCIe lanes which could start a fire. 
Because of that certain settings are protected by signed firmware images.

Undervolting is not that problematic than overclocking or overvolting, 
but you can still do stuff which is outside the hardware specification 
with that.

Christian.
