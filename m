Hi Zaeem,

Page fault was experienced by one of the reporter here:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3693#note_2659173
^ You can find all details (dtn_log and drm_info) in this issue from 
that comment.

As I mentioned, I don't have the proper hardware and environment to 
reproduce their issues.

Thanks,

Melissa
