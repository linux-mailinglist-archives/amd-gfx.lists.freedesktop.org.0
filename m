Windows has supported peer to peer DMA for years so it already has a
numbers of optimizations that are only now becoming possible on Linux.

You'll need the GPU drivers for your devices and dma-buf support.

board vendor shouldn't matter.

pcie_bw is not implemented for navi yet so you are just seeing
uninitialized data.  This patch set should clear that up.
