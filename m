Can you provide the full output of lspci -vvvv. As far as I can see that 
doesn't looks so invalid to me.

Well that is just a very very old workaround for a buggy BIOS on 20 year 
old laptops. The last reference I could find for hardware which actually 
needed it is this:

     [PATCH] PCI: PCI/Cardbus cards hidden, needs pci=assign-busses to fix


So as far as I know nobody had to use that in ages and I wouldn't expect 
that this option actually works correctly on any modern hardware.

Especially not anything PCIe based since it messes up the ACPI to PCIe 
device mappings. That amdgpu doesn't work is just the tip of the iceberg 
here.

The bus assignment code in the PCI subsystem is made to support hotplug, 
not completely re-number the root hubs from scratch. That is just a hack 
somebody came up with two decades ago to get some Cardbus slots in 
laptops working.

I'm not sure yet what's going wrong with the Thunderbold controller, but 
completely re-assigning bus numbers is certainly the wrong approach.

Christian.

In this case the bios has assigned the upstream port 65-68, for its 3
downstreams 66,67,68, and then assigned the upstream port of the
device's own bridge to 67.

In this case not only did BIOS produce an invalid topology but it also
does not provide any space at the first upstream or downstream ports
which the current PCI implementation would require to assign bus
numbers if I understand it correctly.</pre>

The Linux kernel doesnt do the right thing without these features, and
these are not the default. So you may be right that by default it does
not recover from the situation of well.


Given the bus allocation at the root port I can imagine a more
aggressive than default but less aggressive than `assign-busses`
reallocation scheme could deal with both preserving root allocations
like the APU and renumbering things behind upstream ports. That might
be a better approach than renumbering even the root bus devices.</pre>
