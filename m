As far as I know this is only done for graphics shader submissions to the classic CS interface, but not for compute dispatches through ROCm queues.

That's the reason why ROCm needs the remapped MMIO register BAR.

Well the problem is that you absolutely need the HDP flush/invalidation for 100% correctness. It does work most of the time without it, but you then risk data corruption.

Apart from making the flush/invalidate an IOCTL I think we could also just use a global dummy page in VRAM.

If you make two 32bit writes which are apart from each other and then a read back a 32bit value from VRAM that should invalidate the HDP as well. It's less efficient than the MMIO BAR remap but still much better than going though an IOCTL.

The only tricky part is that you need to get the HW barriers with the doorbell write right.....

But don't we also have problems with the doorbell? E.g. the global aggregated one needs to be 4k as well, or is it ok to over allocate there?

Thinking more about it there is also a major problem with page tables. Those are 4k by default on modern systems as well and while over allocating them to 64k is possible that not only wastes some VRAM but can also result in OOM situations because we can't allocate the necessary page tables to switch from 2MiB to 4k pages in some cases.
