The GPU dynamically adjusts the clocks and voltages based on load.  No
manual configuration is required.

At this point, we probably need to see you xorg log and dmesg output
to try and figure out exactly what is going on.  I still suspect there
is some interaction going on with both GPUs and the integrated GPU
being the primary, so as I mentioned before, you should try and run X
on just the amdgpu rather than trying to use both of them.
