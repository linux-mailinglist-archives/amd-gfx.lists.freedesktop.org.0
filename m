FWIW: I could trigger another flip_done timeout.

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/4201

video stream (might even be using hardware decoding) seems like a good
trigger for this. I think most of my flip_done issues had twitch
running while doing something.

Nope. I am just referencing it as it contains more details than I see,
and I wonder what I have to do to get the same amount of extra details
to provide more useful information for you.

on the front of the ring timeout bug: I saw that dxvk had at least one
issue with RDNA4 and ring timeout.

https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4756

So i switched from glorrious eggroll's build to proton experimental
from valve. I have not seen any more ring timeout bugs since.

Which made me wonder why the context shows a steam binary as the owner
of the context and now the wine/game process underneath and if this
could be improved.
