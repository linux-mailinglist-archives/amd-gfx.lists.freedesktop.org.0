A few things that made this more complicated on Linux:
1. Linux uses IOMMUs more extensively than windows so you can't just
pass around physical bus addresses.
2. Linux supports lots of strange architectures that have a lot of
limitations with respect to peer to peer transactions

It just took years to get all the necessary bits in place in Linux and
make everyone happy.

Peer to peer DMA just lets devices access another devices local memory
directly.  So if you have a buffer in vram on one device, you can
share that directly with another device rather than having to copy it
to system memory first.  For example, if you have two GPUs, you can
have one of them copy it's content directly to a buffer in the other
GPU's vram rather than having to go through system memory first.
