We've never had a use case to mix the two.

It was easier to implement them separately because they are self
contained and we don't have to deal with any interactions or
dependencies between real and fake elements of the display pipeline.

And I'd like to be able to access a current X session (either logged in or at the login greeter) both remotely (say via VNC) and locally via the physical display (when it is plugged in).without having to reboot or lose that X session.

It's your display manager (X, mutter, kwin, etc.).  They generally
won't start if they doesn't detect a monitor.  You might be able to
force one via whatever configuration mechanism is provided by your
environment.
