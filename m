now there are jobs coming from inst0, so inst 0 idle handler won't run.

inst 0 work handler runs? could or could not - right? depends on if 
there are more jobs for inst0 and also
if VCN_IDLE_TIMEOUT jiffies has passed for inst0. There is possibly a 
point in the sequence that inst0
stops submit jobs but its idle handler has not run yet. Should we wait 
until all instances have finished their idle handlers?
if not then we will run into a power OFF(by inst1) -> ON(by inst0) for 
the active instance(inst0, expected ON). (active - I mean
those have not timed out in VCN_IDLE_TIMEOUT jiffies and still can 
submit jobs in any time.)
if this could happen then we powered off too early. (I did not say we 
cannot do it but it is not expected)

I see David's concern but his suggestion yet wont solve the problem,
neither the current form , reason :-

The emitted fence count and total submission count are fast transients
which frequently become 0 in between video decodes (between jobs) even
with the atomics and locks there can be a switch of video power profile,
in the current form of patch that window is minimized, but still can
happen if stress tested. But power state of any instance becoming zero

      - if outstanding fences are cleared and no new emitted fence, between

Inst 0 job submission
Inst 0 calls begin_use().  This cancels the current inst worker
thread.  It enables the video profile and ungates the instance.
IBs and fence packets get submitted to instance 0 of the engine
Inst 0 calls end_use().  This schedules the worker thread for
VCN_IDLE_TIMEOUT jiffies in the future.

Inst 1 job submission:
Inst 1 calls begin_use().  This cancels the current inst worker
thread.  It sees the video profile is enabled and ungates the
instance.
IBs and fence packets get submitted to instance 1 of the engine
Inst 1 calls end_use().  This schedules the worker thread for

inst 0 work hander runs.  Sees outstanding fences on inst 0; skips
powergating inst 0, skips disabling video profile. Schedules the
worker thread for VCN_IDLE_TIMEOUT jiffies in the future.

inst 0 IB completes and fence signals

inst 1 IB completes and fence signals

inst 1 work hander runs.  Sees no outstanding fences on inst 1.
