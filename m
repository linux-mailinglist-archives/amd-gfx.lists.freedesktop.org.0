Yes, that is very much appreciated.

It might be related to bug report *Random Soft Lockup on new Ryzen 
build* [1], and the referenced issues there. Itâ€™d be great if you could 
post here or there a summary with your system details (especially the 
system and GPU firmware versions).

Me is still a little upset, how AMD has until now not been able to 
properly analyze and fix this (with the ODMs).


Kind regards,

Paul
