You could set one of the profiles which sets more or less aggressive
clocking, but you still get the advantages of the SMU being able to
dynamically adjust the clocks.  If you manually force the clock to low
or high, you end up forcing all clocks, even if a particular engine is
not in use.  E.g., if you are not using video decode, there is no need
to force the decoder clocks high as well.  Also, if the userspace tool
dies for some reason, that will leave the clocks in the forced state.
