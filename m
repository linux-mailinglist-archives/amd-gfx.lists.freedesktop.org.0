This is upstream. It's your job to show that this can be done,
reasonable, on other devices. This doesn't need to be an intel device,
you can pretty much pick any other driver stack and show that
sufficiently many of them can support what you want to do. But as long
as all I can see is something that only works on AMD, it's not useful
as an upstreamable resource management thing.

This has _nothing_ to do with Intel (I think over the past 25 years or
so intel has implemented all 4 versions of gpu splitting that I
listed, but not entirely sure).

So again pls less tribal fighting, more collaboration. If you can't do
that, let's pick nouveau/nvidia as arbitrary neutral ground.

The thing we can currently do in upstream (from how I'm understanding
hw) is assign entire PCI devices to containers, so essentially only
the entire /dev/dri/* cdev. That works, and it works across all
drivers we have in upstream right now.

Anything more fine-grained I don't think is currently possible,
because everyone has a different idea of how to split up gpus. It
would be nice to have it, but in upstream, cross-vendor, I'm just not
seeing it happen right now.
