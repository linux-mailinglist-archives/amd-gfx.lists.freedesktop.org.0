E.g., some desktop component started polling for display changes or GPU temperature or something like that and when a6c0fd3d5a8b was in place the GPU never entered runtime suspend.  Then when 55285e21f045 was applied, it unmasked the new behavior in the userpace component.

>> In the behavior you are seeing, when the displays come back on after they blank are you seeing the device resume from runtime suspend?  On resume from suspend (runtime or system) we issue a hotplug notification to userspace in case any displays changed during suspend when the GPU was powered down (and hence could not detect a hotplug event).  Perhaps that event is triggering userspace to reprobe and re-enable the displays shortly after resume from runtime suspend due to some other event that caused the device to runtime resume.  Does something like this help by any chance?

We handle re-detection in dm_resume but only seem to call the
drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event for MST. We might want to call it
in dm_resume but that would just move it from amdgpu_device_resume
and will probably cause the same issue.

What I think we'd really want here is to make sure
drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event is only called when any display
config actually changes. Unfortunately, we're not being very
smart in our detection and just recreate everything (even
though dc_link_detect_helper seems to have code that wants to
be smart enough to detect if the sink is changed or not).
This means this change is non-trivial. At least I can't see
an easy fix that doesn't run the risk of breaking a bunch of
stuff.

Or maybe someone can try to see if (non-MST) detection during
RPM still works with your patch. If it does (for some reason)
then we should be good.

I can't seem to repro the problem on my Navi 1x card with KDE Plasma.
I wonder if it's a Polaris issue.

I also don't see my Navi 1x card going into RPM after
'xset dpms force off' with the Manjaro 5.15 kernel. Might need
to try the latest mainline or amd-stg.
