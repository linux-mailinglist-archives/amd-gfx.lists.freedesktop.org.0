So you're testing VGA routing using a non-VGA 3D controller through the
VESA address space?  How does that test anything about VGA routing?

"VGA arbitration" is the mediation of VGA routing between devices, so
I'm confused how you can be focused on the arbitration without the
routing itself.  Thanks,
