Yeah, that was exactly my point when we talked about it.

However, Alex convinced me that we shouldn't bother supporting these degrad=
ed=20
use cases. After spending more time working on amdgpu, I think it would rai=
se=20
more problems than it solves if we allowed that.

=46ortunately now we have ring tests and ring IB tests which we execute on=

initialization to make sure the rings work.

Agreed.
