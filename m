The problem is the cumulative effect of all of these parameters.
Every time there is some change in the driver someone disagrees with
there is a push to add a module parameter for it.  The driver already
has too many module parameters and it's hard to keep them all working
consistently and in every possible combination.  Moreover, the module
options are supposed to be mainly for debugging.  The driver sets
proper defaults for all chips to ensure proper operation, however lots
of random forums seem to treat them like they are the recipe for some
special sauce so users are constantly setting various combinations of
them because they read somewhere on a forum that it would make their
GPU run faster.  More often than not this leads to problems.

Even if we did make the option only valid for these specific chips,
there will be an expectation that future chips will support it as
well, because someone will hack the driver and test it and it may work
for them and then there will be a push to add it for those chips too.
