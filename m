Chiming in here ...

tldr; yes

gpu drivers are ridiculously hard to get right, combinatorial
explosion is a real issue and concern, it's not some hiding behind
corporate rules - drm folks added module_param*unsafe to discourage
users from playing around with options we need for debugging for very,
very real reasons. We have aggressively removed tuning knobs in the
past, and those we have in various drivers are causing endless amounts
of pain.

Also, the "no regression" rules is not ironclad, especially on
power/perf regressions, or all the security fixes would be impossible
to merge. First make it correct (even if the bug has gone unnoticed
for forever), then make it fast/power efficient/pretty/whatever people
fancy. Yes there's some exceptions like "my desktop is crawling like a
slide-show and absolutely unusable" kind of regressions, but my
understanding is this isn't the case here.

So unless Dave or Linus are screaming and overruling Alex here, "do
nothing" is my take here too.
