Well, I am running even heavy memory pressure workloads on linux-next
like every day, and never saw this splat until today where your patch
first show up.

Since I am rather busy tracking another regression, here is the steps to
reproduce (super easy to reproduce on multiple machines here.):

# git clone https://github.com/cailca/linux-mm.git
# cd linux-mm; make
# ./random 0

The .config is in there as well if ever matters.
