lol youre quick!

"Windows has supported peer to peer DMA for years so it already has a
numbers of optimizations that are only now becoming possible on Linux"

whoa, i figured linux would be ahead of windows when it comes to
things like that. but peer-to-peer dma is something that is only
recently possible on linux, but has been possible on windows? what
changed recently that allows for peer to peer dma in linux?

also, in the context of a game running opengl on some gpu, is the
"peer-to-peer" dma transfer something like: the game draw's to some
memory it has allocated, then a DMA transfer gets that and moves it
into the graphics card output?

also, i know it can be super annoying trying to debug an issue like
this, with someone like me who has all types of differences from a
normal setup (e.g. using it via egpu, using a kernel with custom
configs and stuff) so as a token of my appreciation i donated 50$ to
the red cross' corona virus outbreak charity thing, on behalf of
amd-gfx.
