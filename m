This is already exposed with CAP_SYS_NICE and is relied on by SteamVR 
for async reprojection and Gamescope's composite path on Steam Deck.

Having a high priority async compute queue is really really important 
and advantageous for these tasks.

The majority of usecases for something like this is going to be a 
compositor which does some really tiny amount of work per-frame but is 
incredibly latency dependent (as it depends on latching onto buffers 
just before vblank to do it's work)

Starving and surpassing work on other queues is kind of the entire 
point. Gamescope and SteamVR do it on ACE as well so GFX work can run 
alongside it.
