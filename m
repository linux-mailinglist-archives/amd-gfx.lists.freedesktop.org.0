Hi all,

I would like to share an important update based on further testing.

After implementing a temporary workaround, I noticed that the issue is not
limited to suspend/resume. There is a second trigger that seems to affect
the same underlying problem.
=F0=9F=94=8D Additional trigger identified (DPMS / screen off)

Sequence:

   1.

   System resumes from suspend =E2=86=92 works correctly (login screen appe=
ars)
   2.

   System becomes idle =E2=86=92 screen turns off (DPMS)
   3.

   Upon user interaction (keyboard/mouse), the display fails to wake
   properly

Observed behavior:

   -

   Black screen or no signal
   -

   System remains responsive (can sometimes type blindly)
   -

   In some cases, session becomes partially corrupted

Important detail:

This behavior is very similar to what happens after suspend/resume:

   -

   HDMI link is not properly restored
   -

   Monitor may be misdetected or not reinitialized correctly

------------------------------
=F0=9F=A7=AA Workaround behavior

   -

   Disabling the phantom output (DVI-D-1) restores the display immediately
   -

   Forcing HDMI-A-0 as primary also helps reinitialize the session
   -

   Disabling automatic screen-off (DPMS) avoids the issue entirely

------------------------------
=F0=9F=A7=A0 Interpretation

This suggests the problem is not strictly related to suspend, but more
generally to *display reinitialization after power state transitions*,
including:

   -

   suspend/resume (deep)
   -

   screen power off/on (DPMS)

Given that both paths trigger similar failures, this may point to issues in=
:

   -

   EDID re-read after power events
   -

   HDMI link training
   -

   atomic modeset state reconstruction
   -

   DC state restore

------------------------------
=F0=9F=92=A1 Conclusion

The bisected commit may still represent a valid trigger point, but the root
cause appears to be related to how display state is restored after power
transitions, rather than suspend alone.
------------------------------
=F0=9F=93=8E Additional notes

   -

   Wayland still does not show the same hard failure
   -

   Issue remains reproducible
   -

   Workarounds are consistent

------------------------------

I hope this additional information helps narrow down the issue further.

Please let me know if I can assist with more testing.

Thanks again for your time and your work.

Best regards,
Danilo
