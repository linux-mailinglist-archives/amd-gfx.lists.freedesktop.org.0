I hear you but we also have an increasing number of games that don't
even start with 3 GiB. At some point (which I'd speculate has already
been reached, I've seen a number of complaints of games that ran on
deck but not on desktop linux because on deck we set amdgpu.gttsize)
we have more games broken due to the low limit than there would be
apps broken due to a high limit.
