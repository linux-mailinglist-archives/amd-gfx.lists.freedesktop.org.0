Pushed to drm-misc-next.

Thanks a lot and congratulations for your hard work and endurance,
Tvrtko! Good to finally get this significant cleanup in.


dim, however, does report a merge conflict with drm-tip. I looked at
the diff and at first and second glance it doesn't seem to be caused by
this series? The diff I see circles around panthor_gem.c, drm_edid.c,
amdgpu_dm.c.

How can we help resolve it?
