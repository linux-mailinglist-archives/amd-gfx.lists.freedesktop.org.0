The discussion here is derailing. Roman, if we want to have the issue
fixed I support Uwe statement thate we have you, with the affected
hardware, bisect the upstream change to isolate the fixing commit. 

Here are the steps which roughly are involved. Confirm a upstream
version which does not expose the problem. Ideally first though by
using the snapshot.debian.org service as pointed out narrow down more
closely the upstream range where things change. Once you have a set of
kernel which are close enough start bisecting the change. Let's take
te following hypotetical versions, working kernel v6.11 and not
working kernel is v6.12.

|     git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
|     cd linux-stable
|     git checkout v6.11
|     cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
|     yes '' | make localmodconfig
|     make savedefconfig
|     mv defconfig arch/x86/configs/my_defconfig
| 
|     # test 6.11 to ensure this is "good"
|     make my_defconfig
|     make -j $(nproc) bindeb-pkg
|     ... install the resulting .deb package and confirm it successfully boots / problem does not exist
| 
|     # test 6.12 to ensure this is "bad"
|     git checkout v6.12
|     make my_defconfig
|     make -j $(nproc) bindeb-pkg
|     ... install the resulting .deb package and confirm it fails to boot / problem exists
| 
| With that confirmed, the bisection can start:
| 
|     git bisect start
|     git bisect good v6.11
|     git bisect bad v6.12
| 
| In each bisection step git checks out a state between the oldest
| known-bad and the newest known-good commit. In each step test using:
| 
|     make my_defconfig
|     make -j $(nproc) bindeb-pkg
|     ... install, try to boot / verify if problem exists
| 
| and if the problem is hit run:
| 
|     git bisect bad
| 
| and if the problem doesn't trigger run:
| 
|     git bisect good
| 
| . Please pay attention to always select the just built kernel for
| booting, it won't always be the default kernel picked up by grub.
| 
| Iterate until git announces to have identified the first bad commit.
| 
| Then provide the output of
| 
|     git bisect log
| 
| In the course of the bisection you might have to uninstall previous
| kernels again to not exhaust the disk space in /boot. Also in the end
| uninstall all self-built kernels again.

I'm closing this bug along. If you can provide the above version
please respond to this message with the required information and a
control message to reopen the bugreport.

This is how you can help to resolve the issue in my point of view.

Salvatore
