I suspect older DCE 8.x APUs have similar limitations.  Although it
may only be an issue with multiple monitors or something like that.  I
don't remember the details.  @Harry Wentland do you remember?

And amdvlk does have fp16 support now since a while ago, so that's one way to get high precision without disturbing conventional desktop apps. I'll probably look into Mesa's Vulkan/WSI for 10 bpc / fp16 sometime this year if nobody beats me to it.

Sounds good.

One only gets the same precision as a 10 bpc unorm fb. Also the routine is called for all DCE's, not only DCE11, so it affects all of them.

I added a mmio hack to Psychtoolbox to go behind the drivers back and hack the FMT_BIT_DEPTH_CONTROL register to use spatial dithering down to 10 bpc anyway to circumvent this limitation. My photometer measurements on fp16 framebuffers feeding into 10 bit output show that I get a nice looking response consistent with dithering to 10 bpc properly working on DCE. Also i don't see any visual artifacts in displayed pictures, so the hw seems to be just fine. This on DCE-11.2, and more lightly tested on DCE-8.3.
