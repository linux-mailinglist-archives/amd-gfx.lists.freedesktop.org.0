Yeah, but at least on Navi 1x that's so horrible broken that the SDMA 
could write anywhere when we would try this.

Yes, that's the idea. The question is just when we can do the TLB flush.

Well the mapping/unmapping IOCTL should certainly trigger the TLB 
flushes for the user mode queues, but as I said this is completely 
independent to this here.

The limitation is on the kernel CS IOCTL, not the VM IOCTL. So that is 
completely unrelated to this.

Yeah, but as already discussed with Daniel and Jason that will never 
ever work correctly. IOCTLs can't depend on user mode queues in any way. 
So user space can only block or rather call the map, unmap, free 
functions at the right time.

Well as I said that is completely unrelated to user mode queues. The 
restriction is on the CS API, not the VM API.
