I don't follow.  If there are no outstanding fences, there is no
reason to not power down the VCN instance and disable the video
profile. If there are still outstanding fences, then the VCN instance
those fences are associated with will stay on and the video profile
will stay enabled.  If the engine hangs and eventually gets reset, the
fence will be signalled and then there will be no outstanding fences
so the idle handler will eventually disable the power profile.  The
idle handler will keep getting rescheduled as long as there is still
oustanding work.
