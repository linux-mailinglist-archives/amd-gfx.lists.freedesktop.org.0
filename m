I was able to procure an 800W PSU just to give it a try, and at first it 
seemed to make a difference. The drivers would fully load, but after a 
short amount of time things would become unstable and the system would 
crash or reset. Very bizarre...

That was my thinking too. I got the idea to try Windows after I did the 
PSU swap and, like Linux, it was okay at first, but then started crashing 
and resetting. Either the card is defective or it really doesn't like my 
motherboard.

Thanks very much for your help!
