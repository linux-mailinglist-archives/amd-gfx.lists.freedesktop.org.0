Hi Rodrigo,

I have done these tests.

CPU: Kunpeng 920 3211k x24 TSV110 Core

GPU: AMD RX 6400

Monitor on DP: Mi Curved Gaming Monitor 34" (support FreeSync and 3440x1440 at 144Hz on DP)

Monitor on HDMI: a cheap 1080P HDMI capture card (ID: 534d:2109)

Distro: Gentoo with Linux 6.0.5 kernel

Desktop Environment: KDE Plasma

KDE-Plasma-Version: 5.25.5

KDE-Frameworks-Version: 5.99.0

Qt-Version: 5.15.5

Graphics Platform: wayland

I tried to plug and unplug the monitor frequently and quickly on both HDMI and DP port.

Both port works very well. I've also tried various different resolutions on my monitor with no issues.

But I can't set my monitor's refresh rate to 144Hz at 3440x1440. With X11, the 144Hz option won't show up

in the system settings, even xrandr won't show this mode. But with wayland, I can set the refresh rate to 144Hz,

but it results in a black screen. Interestingly, under wayland, if I set the refresh rate to 120Hz, the system works

fine, and the monitor shows that the current refresh rate is 120Hz, but if I restart the system, after re-entering the

desktop, the monitor shows that the current refresh rate is 144Hz. Under X11, the current refresh rate showed

by the monitor is the same as that in system settings. I don't know if that is a hardware limitation of the rx6400

or a software bug.

I guess we might have issues in other non-x86 platforms, but this is something that we can improve over time, and from Ao message, it looks like that DCN is working on ARM.
