My intention was to add a few other drivers as well if the idea is good.
amdgpu just happens to be a codebase I know and can work with hardware I
own.

Yeah, I remember something about this, but then nothing materialized.

Sorry, not signing up for that. It looked easy enough to adjust existing
calls, but anything more complicated and I'm out of time.

If anything, this patch is mostly a signal that user-space would like to
receive CONNECTOR properties. User-space is typed up and ready if any
kernel dev wants to implement this. I'm completely fine with abandonning
this patch.
