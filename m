GMC was replaced by UMC + hubs.

I would include thermal in the first sentence.  E.g., "clock, thermal,
and power management"

Also, the use of "utilization" seems weird.  I think of utilization as
the resources used on the GPU.  Use of the GPU resources is managed by
the scheduler and the driver.  The SMU tries to align performance with
demand.
