After reading your comment in the cover-letter about this diagram, I
made the following modifications:

1. Connect PSP to UMC.
2. Connect PSP to GC.
3. Connect GC to UMC.
4. To avoid confusion, I moved the green block outside each specific IP.
I also changed the explanation about these parts in the text, see it
below.

Here is the new version:

Based on Lijo's comment and Alex's comment in the cover-latter, I
rewrote this paragraph to:

In the diagram, memory-related blocks are shown in green. Notice that
specific IPs have a green square that represents a small hardware block
named 'hub', which is responsible for interfacing with memory. All
memory hubs are connected in the UMCs, which in turn are connected to
memory blocks. As a note, pre-vega devices have a dedicated block for
the Graphic Memory Controller (GMC), which was replaced by UMC in new
architectures. In the driver code, you can identify this component by
looking for the suffix hub, for example: gfxhub, dchub, mmhub, vmhub,
etc. Keep in mind that the component's interaction with the memory block
may vary across architectures. For example, on Navi and newer, GC and
SDMA are both attached to GCHUB; on pre-Navi, SDMA goes through MMHUB;
VCN, JPEG, and VPE go through MMHUB; DCN goes through DCHUB.

What do you think?

Also, keep in mind that this text is part of the below page that already
have some comments about GMC.

I also rewrote this paragraph to address both of your comments:

There is some protection for certain memory elements, and the PSP plays
an essential role in this area. When a specific firmware is loaded into
memory, the PSP takes steps to ensure it has a valid signature. It also
stores firmware images in a protected memory area named Trusted
Memory Area (TMR), so the OS or driver can't corrupt them at runtime. Another
use of PSP is to support the Trusted Application (TA), which is
basically a small application that runs on the trusted processor and
handles a trusted operation (e.g., HDCP). PSP is also used for encrypted
memory for content protection via Trusted Memory Zone (TMZ).

Does it looks good for a v4?

Ok, how about this paragraph for the v4:

Another critical IP is the SMU. It handles reset distribution as well as
clock and power management for all of the IPs on the SoC. SMU also helps
to optimize GPU utilization by balancing performance and power
consumption. Finally, SMU also supports thermal management.
