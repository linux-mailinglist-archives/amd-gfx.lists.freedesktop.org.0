Hi,

Initially noticed this in some games, which seem to be a bit lazy
with their VRAM allocations + freeing, that performance would drop
dramatically / become unusable once the VRAM is full and GTT gets
used. For instance in No Man's Sky after jumping a solar system
or on DCS World on several maps and in multiplayer. I'm using an
ATI/AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT, 8GB VRAM with an eGPU enclosure
(Razer Core X Chroma, Thunderbolt 3), connected via a 40Gbit/s
USB4 port. Which usually has great performance, until I hit the
VRAM limit.

I scripted some further tests and benchmarking around
memmtest_vulkan(*) and these were the results:

https://github.com/T-X/linux-amdgpu-radeon-vram-swapping-test/

I would have expected roughly the same speeds in all tests.
However tests 5) and 6) yielded significantly lower performance.

Which leads me to the conclusion that anything that gets allocated
on GTT stays there and is never unswapped from GTT / system memory
back to VRAM?

I also read that there was some rework with a new TTM allocator
in 2020. But dynamic (un)swapping via TTM seems currently unused?
Is this expected?
