I see.
Yeah, I've only very rarely seen that issue myself. Seems that the bug avoi=

driver devs, but it's very popular among end users.

I agree.

Thanks for the explanation.
Just one more question: does DCN always mask the VSTARTUP interrupt under=20
those conditions or is that configurable?

That's very nice to hear. I'm crossing my fingers that it works out.

Do we have any reports of these page flip timeouts on DCE?
Maybe it's better to leave DCE well enough alone if the issue doesn't exist=
=20
there. (I have never seen one, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.)
