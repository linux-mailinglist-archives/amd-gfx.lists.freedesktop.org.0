Hi Harry,

Thank you for explaning the latest changes in the color pipeline.
Since MCM is fixed pre-blending in the current dcn32 driver:

1. I understand that the implementation for post-blending shaper/3dlut
isn't available in the current dcn32 driver, right?

2. Does the dcn32 hardware itself support the configuration of both pre-
and post-blending shaper/3dlut at the same time? Or, for example, dcn32
will advertise two color pipelines: one with pre-blending 3dlut and no
post-blending, and another without pre-blending and only post-blending
3dlut?
