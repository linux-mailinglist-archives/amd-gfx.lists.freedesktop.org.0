I'm not sure yet if these are related to this patch series, but I never noticed it before. I wonder if the freezes might occur when GPU preemption is attempted.

Keep in mind that this doesn't have the same fine granularity as the 
separate hw ring buffer found on gfx10.

With MCBP we can only preempt on draw command boundary, while the 
separate hw ring solution can preempt as soon as a CU is available.

I don't think that this will be a good idea. The hw ring buffer or even 
hw scheduler have much nicer properties and we should focus on getting 
that working when available.

Even though mutter uses a high priority context via the EGL_IMG_context_priority extension, it's unable to reach a higher frame rate than a GPU-limited client[0].
