The work handler will run unless it is cancelled in begin_use(), but
in that case, it will get scheduled again in end_use().  If it runs,
but there is still outstanding work (fences), then it will get
scheduled to run again in the work handler.  All we are about from the
power and video profile perspective is whether or not there are still
outstanding fences.  Once all fences are completed on all instances,
we can disable the video profile regardless of whether then the idle
handlers have run or not because the hw is already idle.

VCN_IDLE_TIMEOUT is not a timeout.  We could call it something else.
VCN_IDLE_CHECK_PERIOD is a better description.  It just runs in the
future to check if all of the fences are signalled.  If they are not
signalled, we schedule the worker to run again further in the future.
If you reduce the time, it will check more often, you can potentially
save more power, but you add more CPU overhead because the handler may
run more often.
