I don't really think that is the case.  E.g., rocm-smi expects the
values to be ordered.  As was previously discussed, this was
originally added as an interface to see what the current DPM state was
and as a way to mask out specific DPM states.  When discrete DPM
states went away, we end up with just a min and max so a middle step
was added to show the current clock in relation to the min and max.
When the clock is on, DPM is active and the clock should be >=3D min and
<=3D max.

With over- or under-clocking, shouldn't the min/max change instead?

I'm fine with dropping the * for cases outside of the min/max, but I
think clamping works as well.  E.g., while SMU reports 0 in some
cases, that could be due to the clock being off or the block being
powergated.  It's still in the lowest state.  If the clock were on, it
would be in the lowest state.  Same thing on the high end.  It's
possible there is a little slop in the clock calculations for
stability.  E.g., the clock may be a few Mhz above the max because SMU
determined that the current max frequency was not stable in
combination with some other clock.  It's still ostensibly in the
highest DPM state.
